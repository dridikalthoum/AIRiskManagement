PLAN RISK RESPONSES
T he Plan Risk Responses process determines effective response actions that are appropriate to the priority
of the individual risks and to the overall project risk. It takes into account the stakeholders’ risk attitudes and
the conventions specifi ed in the Risk Management Plan, in addition to any constraints and assumptions that
were determined when the risks were identifi ed and analyzed.
8.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Responses Process
T he objective of the Plan Risk Responses process is to determine the set of actions which most enhance the
chances of project success while complying with applicable organizational and project constraints.
Once risks have been identifi ed, analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be developed for addressing every
risk the project team considers to be suffi ciently important, either because of the threat it poses to the project
objectives or the opportunity it offers. The planning entails agreeing upon the actions to be taken and the
potential changes to budget, schedule, resources, and scope which these actions might cause.
Contingent risk response actions need to be executed at the optimum time. For this reason, the response
specifi cation for each such risk should include a description of any corresponding trigger conditions.
T he responsibility for monitoring the project conditions and implementing the corresponding actions should
be clearly assigned. Every risk should have been allocated to a risk owner as part of the Identify Risks process,
and each of the corresponding risk responses should now be assigned to a specifi c risk action owner. The risk
owner is responsible for ensuring that the risk response is effective and for planning additional risk responses
if required, whereas the risk action owner is responsible for ensuring that the agreed-upon risk responses are
carried out as planned, in a timely manner. The role of the risk owner and that of the risk action owner may be
assigned to a single person.
R esponses, when implemented, can have potential effects on the project objectives and, as such, can
generate additional risks. These are known as secondary risks and have to be analyzed and planned for in the
same way as those risks which were initially identifi ed.
I t is never feasible or even desirable to eliminate all threats from a project. Similarly, there is also a limit
to the extent to which opportunities can be proactively managed. There may be residual risks that will remain
after the responses have been implemented. These residual risks should be clearly identifi ed, analyzed,
documented, and communicated to all relevant stakeholders.

A ll the approved, unconditional actions arising from risk response planning should be integrated into the
project management plan in order to ensure that they are carried out as part of normal project implementation. The
corresponding organizational and project management rules should also be invoked, including the following:
(cid:129) Project change management and confi guration control;
(cid:129) Project planning, budgeting, and scheduling;
(cid:129) Resource management; and
(cid:129) Project communication planning.
8.2 Critical Success Factors for the Plan Risk Responses Process
A range of factors are important for the success of the Plan Risk Responses process. These are described
in Sections 8.2.1 through 8.2.8 and shown in Figure 8-1.
Figure 8-1. Critical Success Factors for Risk Response Planning
8 .2.1 Communicate
Communication with the various stakeholders should be maintained in an open and appropriate manner. The
resulting plans are disseminated and approval obtained in order to ensure full acceptance by all stakeholders.
I n addition, if organizational causes of risks, such as culture, attitudes, or disagreements concerning
objectives are present, they should be addressed openly. This may require involving high levels of the
organization’s management and other stakeholders.

8.2.2 Clearly Defi ne Risk-Related Roles and Responsibilities
The risk response success will be dependent upon the full support and involvement of the project team and
other stakeholders. The key roles for Project Risk Management are those of risk owner and risk action owner.
A single risk owner should be assigned to every identifi ed risk, and each agreed-upon risk response should
have a single risk action owner. The people with the corresponding responsibilities should be aware of what is
expected of them, and the other project stakeholders should understand and accept the needs and authority
of these roles.
Management may take ownership of risks with political, organizational causes. In addition, senior
management should approve and track associated risk-related contingency reserves.
8.2.3 Specify Timing of Risk Responses
Agreed-upon responses should be integrated into the project management plan and will therefore be
scheduled and assigned for execution. The responses that depend on uncertain conditions should also be
monitored so as to be performed if the conditions warrant them.
8.2.4 Provide Resources, Budget, and Schedule for Responses
E ach response should be planned in detail in accordance with the methodology of the project and integrated
into the project management plan. This entails estimating the resources, costs, and duration; updating the
budget and schedule; obtaining approval from management; and obtaining commitment from the risk owners
and risk action owners. Management’s role at this stage is vital for supporting the project manager in developing
risk responses and authorizing the corresponding resources.
8.2.5 Address the Interaction of Risks and Responses
R esponses may be developed to address risks related either by cause and effect or by common root cause.
Categorization of risks, for example by using tools such as the risk breakdown structure, affi nity diagram, or
other categorizing tools, may help identify and address this situation. There is also a need during the Plan Risk
Responses process to consider the risks aggregated during the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process
(e.g., ten small, related risks combined may pose a big risk to the project), and then to develop generic
responses where possible. Another interaction effect that may occur is when one risk, if it occurs, may affect
the probability or impact of other risks.
Deciding on the response strategy may require a compromise, since some proposed responses may be
mutually exclusive or counterproductive. For example mitigating a threat to time could cost money, thereby
increasing pressure on the budget. Risk response planning also needs to take a holistic view of all proposed
responses and make sure they are coherent.
©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
The challenge therefore in planning responses to risks is the need to control the potential effects of the
strategy developed for treating the original risk. If this is overlooked, the total level of threat in a project can
actually increase, or the potential for opportunities can be compromised.
8.2.6 Ensure Appropriate, Timely, Effective, and Agreed-Upon Responses
I n general, responses should be appropriate, timely, cost-effective, feasible, achievable, agreed-upon,
assigned, and accepted. Any proposed risk response plan needs to be assessed against the following criteria:
(cid:129) Consistency with organizational values, project objectives, and stakeholder expectations;
(cid:129) Technical feasibility;
(cid:129) Ability of the project team or risk action owners outside the project to carry out the corresponding
actions; and
(cid:129) Balance between overall impact of the response on the project objectives and the improvement in
the risk profi le of the project.
8.2.7 Address Both Threats and Opportunities
Risk response planning should combine responses that address the threats as well as those that provide
for opportunities into a single, integrated plan. If either threats or opportunities are not fully addressed, the
combined set of response strategies will be incomplete and may even be invalid.
8.2.8 Develop Strategies before Tactical Responses
Risk response planning should be carried out in an open-minded manner rather than adopting the fi rst
response that seems to be feasible. The responses should be planned at a general, strategic level and the
strategy validated and agreed upon, prior to developing the detailed tactical approach.
Once the responses have been planned at a strategic level, they should be expanded into actions at the tactical
level and integrated into the project management plan (e.g., schedule, budget, and resource assignments). This
activity may generate additional secondary risks, which will need to be addressed at this time.
8.3 Risk Response Strategies
T he project manager should develop risk response strategies for individual risks, sets of risks, and project-
level risks. An overview of the steps in arriving at a complete set of responses is given in Figure 8-2.
T he affected stakeholders should be involved in determining the strategies. Once the strategies have been
selected, they need to be agreed upon by the entity that approves those strategies. There are four strategies
which address individual risks for threats and opportunities as described in Sections 8.3.1 through 8.3.4 (see
also Fig. 8-2).
©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
8.3.1 Avoid a Threat or Exploit an Opportunity
T his strategy involves taking the actions required to address a threat or an opportunity in order to ensure
either that the threat cannot occur or can have no effect on the project, or that the opportunity will occur and
the project will be able to take advantage of it.
8.3.2 Transfer a Threat or Share an Opportunity
This strategy entails transference to a third party that is better positioned to address a particular threat or
opportunity.
8.3.3 Mitigate a Threat or Enhance an Opportunity
M itigation and enhancement are the most widely applicable and widely used response strategies. Here, the
approach is to identify actions that will decrease the probability and/or the impact of a threat, and increase the
probability and/or the impact of an opportunity.
8.3.4 Accept a Threat or an Opportunity
This strategy applies when the other strategies are not considered applicable or feasible. Acceptance entails
taking no action unless the risk actually occurs, in which case contingency or fallback plans may be developed
ahead of time, to be implemented if the risk presents itself.
8.3.5 Applying Risk Response Strategies to Overall Project Risk
In addition to responding to individual risks, the four risk response strategies can be applied to address
overall project risk as follows:
(cid:129) Cancel the project, as a last resort, if the overall level of risk remains unacceptable.
(cid:129) Set up a business structure in which the customer and the supplier share the risk.
(cid:129) Re-plan the project or change the scope and boundaries of the project, for example, by modifying the
project priority, resource allocations, delivery calendar, etc.
(cid:129) Pursue the project despite a risk exposure that exceeds the desired level.
8.4 Tools and Techniques for the Plan Risk Responses Process
There are four categories of tools and techniques, as follows:
(cid:129) Creativity tools to identify potential responses,
(cid:129) Decision-support tools for determining the optimal potential response.
(cid:129) Strategy implementation techniques designed to turn a strategy into action, and
(cid:129) Tools to transfer control to the Monitor and Control Risks process.
©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
T hese categories of tools can be used respectively to identify potential responses, select the most
appropriate response, translate strategy into planning, and assign the corresponding actions. The steps
involved in planning risk responses are shown in Figure 8.2.
8.4.1 Response Identifi cation
Risk response planning builds on the available information about the potential risks and aims to determine
the optimal set of responses. For this reason, it should involve subject matter experts and employ creativity
techniques in order to explore all of the options. Project planning and execution techniques are then required
to evaluate the potential effects of the various options on the project’s objectives.
8.4.2 Response Selection
Once the set of potential responses for the risks being addressed is established, decision-support techniques
may need to be applied to select the best possible subset from these responses. The selection process should
take into account the cost of the responses, the impact on the project objectives, uncertainty of outcomes and
the possible secondary and residual risks. The Identify Risks, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, and Plan Risk
Responses processes may then need to be applied to the resultant project management plan and the residual
and secondary risks that it would entail. This iterative approach continues until all of the individual risks are
deemed acceptable and the overall risk is within a predefi ned threshold.
8.4.3 Action Planning
Project planning tools are used to turn the chosen strategies into concrete actions and to integrate these into
existing plans. The corresponding actions may be unconditional (i.e., integrated into the project management
plan) or contingent on a trigger condition and predefi ned as a contingency response strategy.
8.4.4 Ownership and Responsibility Assignment
T he project manager needs to use resource assignment processes to ensure the availability of an owner for
each risk and for each response action, so that each associated risk is managed and each corresponding risk
response is carried out in a timely and effective manner.
To enable risk monitoring to identify the imminence or actual occurrence of the corresponding event, every
contingency response strategy should include a set of trigger conditions. The responsibility for monitoring
these conditions should be clearly assigned in the Plan Risk Responses process and managed in the Monitor
and Control Risks process.
©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management
The strategic defi nition of risk responses should include measurable criteria for success of the response.
Risk action owners should monitor their assigned risks, take agreed-upon actions as required, and provide
the risk owners with relevant information on status or changes to the risk characteristics. Risk owners should
assess the effectiveness of any actions, decide whether additional actions are required, and keep the project
manager informed of the situation.

8.5 Documenting the Results of the Plan Risk Responses Process
R isk response planning is based on the information placed in the risk register during execution of the
Identify Risks and Perform Analysis processes. The corresponding risk response information is often referred
to as the risk response plan, although it may in fact be an integral part of the risk register.
8.5.1 Add Risk Responses to the Risk Register
T he response-related information for each risk is recorded in the risk register and updated regularly. Any
interested stakeholder should be able to rapidly access all the information required to verify their responsibilities
and manage the risk in accordance with the risk response plan. The set of residual risks and their priorities
are clearly identifi ed and recorded.
8.5.2 Add Corresponding Risk Responses to the Project Management Plan
W hile developing the detailed set of risk responses, the project-related implications are evaluated for
inclusion in a modifi ed project management plan. These include costs, resource assignments, scheduling
details, and changes to project documentation. Until these changes are formally approved along with the
additional risks that they may carry, risk response planning cannot be considered complete.
8.5.3 Review and Document Predicted Exposure
O nce the risk responses have been defi ned and integrated into the project management plan, the individual
and overall residual risks related to this plan are evaluated in order to determine whether additional response
planning is required, as shown in Figure 8-2. This evaluation should provide an estimate of both the expected
post-response situation and the potential improvement of the risk exposure assuming that the proposed
responses are effective. The evaluation should be documented.
