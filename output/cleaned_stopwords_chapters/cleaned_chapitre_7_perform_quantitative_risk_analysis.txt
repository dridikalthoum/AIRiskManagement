PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS Purpose Objectives Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis Process Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process provides numerical estimate overall effect risk objectives project based current plans information considering risks simultaneously Results type analysis used evaluate likelihood success achieving project objectives estimate contingency reserves usually time
