PRINCIPLES CONCEPTS Introduction chapter introduces key ideas required understand apply Project Risk Management projects following approach described Chapter P MBOK Guide Fourth Edition principles concepts generally consistent approaches Project Risk Management commonly used although terminology may differ details execution Project Risk Management process dealt subsequent chapters practice standard discussed Defi nition Project Risk word risk used many ways everyday language various specialist disciplines use P MBOK G uide Fourth Edition consistent risk management standards process descriptions defi nition project risk given PMBOK Guide Fourth Edition follows P roject risk uncertain event condition occurs positive negative effect project objectives defi nition includes two key dimensions risk uncertainty effect project objectives assessing importance project risk two dimensions must considered uncertainty dimension may described using term probability effect may called impact though descriptors possible likelihood consequence defi nition risk includes distinct events uncertain clearly described general conditions less specifi also may give risk uncertainty defi nition project risk also encompasses uncertain events could negative effect project objectives well could positive effect two types risk called respectively threats opportunities important address threats opportunities within unifi ed Project Risk Management process allows gain synergies effi ciencies addressing analyses coordinating responses overlap reinforce Project Management Institute Practice Standard Project Risk Management R isks uncertain future events conditions may may occur would matter occur important distinguish risks risk related features cause effect Causes events circumstances currently exist certain exist future might give rise risks Effects conditional future events conditions would directly affect one project objectives associated risk occurs cause risk effect chain used structured risk statement risk description ensure three elements properly described see Section risk event occurs ceases become uncertain Threats occur may called issues problems opportunities occur may called benefi ts issues problems benefi ts entail project management actions outside scope Project Risk Management process Individual Risks Overall Project Risk useful consider project risk two levels individual risks overall project risk ndividual risks specifi events conditions might affect project objectives individual risk may positively negatively affect one project objectives elements tasks Understanding individual risks assist determining apply effort resources enhance chances project success Day day Project Risk Management focuses individual risks order

individual risk overall project risk matters wide range factors infl uence risk attitude include scale project within range stakeholders overall activities strength public commitments made performance project stakeholders sensitivity issues environmental impacts industrial relations factors Stakeholder risk attitudes usually result desire increased certainty project outcomes may express preference one project objective another risk regarded usually also strongly infl uenced organization culture Different organizations less open often impacts way risk management applied Project Management Institute Practice Standard Project Risk Management Understanding stakeholders attitudes toward risk important component risk management planning precedes risk identifi cation analysis order optimize project success stakeholder satisfaction project results attitudes identifi ed managed proactively deliberately throughout Project Risk Management process may differ one project another stakeholders usually differ one group stakeholders another fact single stakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes various stages project also important understand particular implications stakeholder risk

time goes risks occur others new risks arise discovered characteristics already identifi ed may change result Project Risk Management processes repeated corresponding plans progressively elaborated throughout lifetime project ensure Project Risk Management remains effective identifi cation analysis risks revisited periodically progress risk response actions monitored action plans adjusted

Management may considered simplistic say risk management everyone responsibility previously stated However important management project risk left risk specialists Project Risk Management included
