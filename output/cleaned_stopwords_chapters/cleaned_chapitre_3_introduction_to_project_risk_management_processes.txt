INTRODUCTION PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES Project Risk Management Project Management projects uncertain Uncertainty inevitable since projects unique temporary undertakings based assumptions constraints delivering project results multiple stakeholders different requirements Project management seen attempt control uncertain environment use structured disciplined techniques estimating planning cost control task allocation earned value analysis monitoring review meetings etc elements project management role defi ning controlling uncertainty inherent projects P roject Risk Management provides approach uncertainty understood assessed managed within projects forms integral part project management effective Project Risk Management critical success factor project success F project management fully effective however important Project Risk Management viewed optional process performed additional overhead task Since many elements project management address inherent uncertainty interface structured Project Risk Management processes project management needs clear outputs Project Risk Management taken account within many project management processes example impact Estimating resource requirements cost duration Assessing impact proposed scope changes Planning planning forward strategy project Allocating resources tasks Reporting progress stakeholders one actions performed properly without clear view risk involved determined Project Risk Management process words project management process effectiveness increased using information results Project Risk Management addition

emergent nature risk requires Project Risk Management process iterative repeating Identify Risks process order fi nd risks evident earlier project Input sought wide range project stakeholders identifying risks since different perspective risks facing project Historical records project documents also reviewed identify risks project identifi ed risks recorded Ideally risk owner designated identifi ed risk responsibility risk owner manage corresponding risk subsequent Project Risk Management processes Following risk identifi cation necessary evaluate importance risk order prioritize individual risks attention evaluate level overall project risk determine appropriate responses Risk evaluation performed using qualitative techniques address individual risks using quantitative techniques consider overall effect risk project outcome using combination two approaches require different types data qualitative quantitative techniques used integrated approach adopted Qualitative techniques used gain better understanding individual risks considering range characteristics probability occurrence degree impact project objectives manageability timing possible impacts relationships risks common causes effects etc Understanding prioritizing risks essential prerequisite managing qualitative techniques used projects outputs qualitative assessments documented communicated key project stakeholders form basis determining appropriate responses Q uantitative techniques provide insights combined effect identifi ed risks project outcome techniques take account probabilistic

understood appropriate risk responses developed using iterative process continues optimal set responses developed range possible response strategies exists threats opportunities risk owner select suitable strategy individual risk based characteristics assessed priority ensuring strategy achievable affordable cost effective appropriate use single strategy addresses several related risks

identify secondary risks may arise implementation risk responses addition individual risk responses actions may taken respond overall project risk response strategies actions documented communicated key project stakeholders incorporated project plan essential agreed upon actions implemented otherwise risk exposure project remains unchanged also vital Project Risk Management process repeated
