PERFORM QUALITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS Purpose Objectives Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process assesses evaluates characteristics individually identifi ed project risks prioritizes risks based agreed upon characteristics Assessing individual risks using qualitative risk analysis evaluates probability risk occur effect individual risk project objectives directly address overall risk project objectives results combined effect risks potential interactions however achieved use quantitative risk analysis techniques see Chapter One step analysis categorize risks according sources causes several risks arise common source sometimes called root cause risk responses may effective focus addressing root cause dentifying common effects groups risks allows identifi cation areas greatest risk exposure e g project completion date budget particular deliverable scope facilitating risk response focus areas methods qualitative risk analysis applied list risks created updated Identify Risks process provide project management characteristics risks infl uence positive negative achieving project objectives Risks assessed high priority either threaten enhance achievement project objectives important focus Plan Risk Responses process may analyzed analysis overall project risk discussed Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process Critical Success Factors Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process Several factors lead successful qualitative risk analysis described Sections summarized Figure Agreement project stakeholders fundamental criterion common theme agreed upon approach foundation process credibility agreed upon defi nitions enable high quality information collected Finally conditions place process executed reliably contributes credibility outputs Project Management Institute Practice Standard Project Risk Management Figure Building Risk Analysis Credibility Use Agreed Upon Approach process based agreed upon approach assessment applied across identifi ed risks project nature project risk risks may assessed according probability occurrence impact individual objectives risk occur factors may considered determining importance risk follows Urgency proximity Risks requiring near term responses may considered urgent address Indicators urgency include lead time necessary execute risk response clarity symptoms warning signs also known detectability may trigger response Manageability risks manageable would waste resources attempt address project team may examine decide Go forward perhaps establishing contingency reserve Stop scope project risks pose unmanageable threat opportunity missed high probability consequences Inform customer risks ask decision point view mpact external project risk may increase importance affects enterprise beyond project Use Agreed Upon Defi nitions Risk Terms risk assessment based agreed upon defi nitions important terms defi nitions used consistently assessing risk use defi nitions example levels probability impact objectives assists providers information giving realistic assessments risk facilitates communication results management stakeholders Project Management Institute Practice Standard Project Risk Management Collect High Quality Information Risks ollection high quality information risks required Often information available historic database gathered interviews workshops means using expert judgment Data gathered individuals may subject reporting intentional bias occurs bias identifi ed remedied possible different unbiased source information found used Perform Iterative Qualitative Risk Analysis success qualitative risk analysis enhanced process used periodically throughout project impossible know advance risks may occur project therefore Identify Risks Perform Qualitative Analysis processes repeated periodically individual risks frequency effort planned Plan Risk Management process may also depend events within project Tools Techniques Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process tools techniques used assessing individual risks identify risks important project success process illustrated Figure Figure Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process Project Management Institute Practice Standard Project Risk Management Select Risk Characteristics Defi Risks Importance Q ualitative risk analysis tools provide ways distinguish risks important response analysis less important criteria make risk interest management agreed upon advance implemented tools used Output qualitative risk analysis tools includes listing risks priority order priority groups e g high moderate low tools qualitative risk analysis allow organization project stakeholders specify levels combinations risk characteristics make particular risk interest management tools assess risk importance combination probability occurrence degree impact objectives Collect Analyze Data ssessment individual risks based information collected Therefore data collection evaluation tools including interviews workshops references databases prior projects require management support attention important protect bias data gathering important relying expert judgment information Prioritize Risks Probability Impact Specifi Objectives ome tools permit distinguishing risk priority terms affected objective capability provides list risks important specifi objective interest management useful since common risks uneven impacts various project objectives Prioritize Risks Probability Impact Overall Project reasons constructing measure specifi risk importance entire project contrasted importance specifi objectives common reason ease communication management stakeholders single risk prioritization index needed organization explicit index created Usually index refl ects organization preference among objectives technique creating overall risk priority measure documented Plan Risk Management process Project Management Institute Practice Standard Project Risk Management Categorize Risk Causes Categorizing risks appropriately may lead improved analysis probability magnitude project risk effective responses Understanding relationships risks may provide better understanding possibility magnitude project risk risks considered separate independent events Identifying common root causes group risks instance may reveal magnitude risk event group whole along effective strategies might address several risks simultaneously Alternatively risks may linked others causal chain understanding chain risks may lead better understanding implication risk project Identifying risks occur time using resources recovery might provide realistic picture problems risk mitigation using scarce resources Combining results Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process risk breakdown structure see Identify Risks Chapter show clusters priority risks arising specifi sources combination risk analysis information work breakdown structure WBS show areas project exhibit risk Assessing high priority risks impact one objective schedule may indicate activities address reduce objective uncertainty approaches contribute realism usefulness qualitative risk analysis Document Results Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process adds structure list undifferentiated risks see Identify Risks Chapter categories priority Priorities usually based risk probability occurring potential impact specifi project objectives whole project identifi ed risk assigned priority perhaps objective entire project information usually stored risk register easy use update new information risk register list prioritized risks posted project participants responsible analysis action improve project plan Risks judged high priority
