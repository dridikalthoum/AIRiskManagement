IDENTIFY RISKS Purpose Objectives Identify Risks Process risk cannot managed unless fi rst identifi ed Consequently risk management planning completed fi rst process iterative Project Risk Management process aims identify knowable risks project objectives however impossible identify risks outset project time level project risk exposure changes result decisions actions taken previously project internal change externally imposed change purpose risk identifi cation identify risks maximum extent practicable fact risks unknowable emergent requires Identify Risk process iterative repeating Identify Risks process fi nd new risks become knowable since previous iteration process W hen risk fi rst identifi ed potential responses may also identifi ed time recorded Identify Risks process

maximize value effectiveness Identify Risks process enhance likelihood identifying many risks practicable Early Identifi cation R isk identifi cation performed early possible project lifecycle recognizing paradox uncertainty high initial stages project often less information base risk identifi cation Early risk identifi cation enables key project decisions take maximum account risks inherent project may result changes project strategy also maximizes time available development implementation risk responses enhances effi ciency since responses taken early often normally less costly later ones Project Management Institute Practice Standard Project Risk Management Iterative Identifi cation Since risks identifi ed given point project essential risk identifi cation repeated

allow open honest identifi cation many risks possible project Tools Techniques Identify Risks Process range tools techniques available risk identifi cation fall following three categories illustrated Figure Figure Three Perspectives Risk Identification Project Management Institute Practice Standard Project Risk Management Historical Review Historical reviews based occurred past either project similar projects organization comparable projects organizations Historical review approaches rely careful selection comparable situations genuinely similar current project fi ltering data ensure relevant previous risks considered case risks identifi ed selected historical situation considered asking whether similar risks might arise project Current Assessments urrent assessments rely detailed
