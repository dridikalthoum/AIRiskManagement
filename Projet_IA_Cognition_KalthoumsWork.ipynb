            "Sentence 1: 1 chapter 1 introduction p roject management institute pmi practice standards are guides to the use of a tool technique or process identifi ed in a guide to the project management body of knowledge pmbok g uide fourth edition or other pmi standards practice standards are targeted at audiences who participate in the management of projects this includes project managers project personnel contract personnel supervisors and other project stakeholders a pmi practice standard describes processes activities inputs and outputs for a specifi c knowledge area it provides information on what the signifi cant process tool or technique is what it does why it is signifi cant when it should be performed or executed and if necessary for further clarifi cation who should perform the process a practice standard does not prescribe how the process is to be implemented leaving that subject for other forums such as handbooks manuals and courses this chapter includes the following sections 11 purpose of the practice standard for project risk management 12 project risk management defi nition 13 role of project risk management in project management 14 good risk management practice 15 critical success factors for project risk management 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 1 1 chapter 1 introduction 11 purpose of the practice standard for project risk management t he purpose of the practice standard for project risk management is to a provide a standard for project management practitioners and other stakeholders that defi nes the aspects of project risk management that are recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and b provide a standard that is globally applicable and consistently applied this practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes the practice standard for project risk management covers risk management as it is applied to single projects only like the p mbok guide fourth edition this practice standard does not cover risk in programs or portfolios of projects c hapter 11 of the p mbok guide fourth edition is the basis for the p ractice standard for project risk management this practice standard is consistent with that chapter emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to project risk management it is aligned with other pmi practice standards figure 11 compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the p mbok g uide fourth edition and textbooks handbooks and courses figure 11 hierarchy of pmi project risk management resources 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 2 1 chapter 1 introduction this practice standard is organized in three main sections 1 i ntroductory material including the framework purpose principles context of and introduction to project risk management processes as defi ned in the pmbok guide fourth edition 2 principles underlying the six project risk management processes in the p mbok g uide fourth edition the six processes are as follows plan risk management identify risks perform qualitative risk analysis perform quantitative risk analysis plan risk responses and monitor and control risks e ach of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics a purpose and objectives of the process b critical success factors for the process c tools and techniques for the process and d documenting the results of the process 3 a glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard t his practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective comprehensive and successful project risk management these principles can and should be stated at a general level for several reasons 1 p rinciples are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future while tools and techniques are constantly evolving the principles have more stability and persistence 2 different projects organizations and situations will require different approaches to project risk management in particular risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to apply to both large and small projects risk management will be more effective if its practice is tailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture processes and assets there are many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of project risk management as presented in this practice standard 3 the principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context refl ecting the many business and organizational arrangements between participants for example joint ventures between commercial and national companies government and nongovernment organizations and the crosscultural environment often found on these project teams t he principles described herein can be used as a check for an organizations processes practitioners can establish processes specifi c to their particular situation project or organization and then compare them with these principles thus validating them against good project risk management practice 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 3 1 chapter 1 introduction 12 project risk management defi nition t he defi nition of project risk management as defi ned in the p mbok guide fourth edition is the basis for this practice standard project risk management includes the processes concerned with conducting risk management planning identifi cation analysis responses and monitoring and control on a project the pmbok guide fourth edition also states the objectives of project risk management are to increase the probability and impact of positive events and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the project in the pmbok g uide fourth edition project risk is an uncertain event or condition that if it occurs has a positive or negative effect on a projects objectives project objectives include scope schedule cost and quality project risk management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence and provide actionoriented information to project managers this orientation requires consideration of events that may or may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as their impact on objectives 13 role of project risk management in project management p roject risk management is not an optional activity it is essential to successful project management it should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents in this way it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project in every phase and in every process group many of the project management processes address planning the project from concept to fi nal design and from procurement through daily management of execution and closeout these processes often assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and therefore they need to include treatment of project risks project risk management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions therefore it builds upon and extends other project management processes for instance project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project project risk management is not a substitute for the other project management processes on the contrary project risk management requires that these project management processes eg scheduling budgeting and change management be performed at the level of the best practices available project risk management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account for instance risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of confi dence for meeting project objectives 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 4 1 chapter 1 introduction there is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects in the early stages of a project the level of risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum this situation does not mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time rather there may be different ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications the more this situation is recognized the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be a risk management approach is applicable throughout a projects life cycle the earlier in the project life cycle that the risks are recognized the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be risk management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment such as stakeholders scope time and cost as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints the balance between project fl exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop i t is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions agreements and contracts in place the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced during project execution risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible project risk management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future f inally throughout the project and during project closure riskrelated lessons are reviewed in order to contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of project risk management practice 14 good risk management practice p roject risk management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of the other project management processes as with all of these processes project risk management should be conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies in addition like the other processes involved in project management project risk management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project project risk management should recognize the business challenges as well as the multicultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers suppliers and workforces spread around the globe changes in the project management plan that result from the project risk management process may require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel establish or modify budgets make commitments to others outside the project interact with regulators and comply with the rules of accounting and law project risk management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 5 1 chapter 1 introduction project risk management should always be conducted on an ethical basis in keeping with the project management code of ethics or conduct honesty responsibility realism professionalism and fair dealing with others are among the characteristics of successful project risk management effective project risk management benefi ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders this enables agreement among stakeholders that project risk management in general and risk identifi cation analysis and response in particular should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable infl uences project risk management should be conducted on all projects the degree level of detail sophistication of tools and amount of time and resources applied to project risk management should be in proportion to the characteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome thus a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources time and attention to project risk management than would a smaller shortterm internal project that can be conducted in the background with a fl exible deadline e ach of the project risk management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under management during the plan risk management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions made in that process remain appropriate 15 critical success factors for project risk management figure 12 critical success factors for project risk management 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 6 1 chapter 1 introduction s pecifi c criteria for success of each project risk management process are listed in the chapters dealing with those processes the general criteria for success include recognize the value of risk management project risk management should be recognized as a valuable discipline that provides a positive potential return on investment for organizational management project stakeholders both internal and external project management and team members individual commitmentresponsibility project participants and stakeholders should all accept responsibility for undertaking riskrelated activities as required risk management is everybodys responsibility open and honest communication everyone should be involved in the project risk management process any actions or attitudes that hinder communication about project risk reduce the effectiveness of project risk management in terms of proactive approaches and effective decisionmaking organizational commitment organizational commitment can only be established if risk management is aligned with the organizations goals and values project risk management may require a higher level of managerial support than other project management disciplines because handling some of the risks will require approval of or responses from others at levels above the project manager risk effort scaled to project project risk management activities should be consistent with the value of the project to the organization and with its level of project risk its scale and other organizational constraints in particular the cost of project risk management should be appropriate to its potential value to the project and the organization integration with project management project risk management does not exist in a vacuum isolated from other project management processes successful project risk management requires the correct execution of the other project management processes these critical success factors for project risk management are illustrated in figure 12 16 conclusion t he principles of project risk management described in this practice standard should be appropriately applied based on the specifi cs of a project and the organizational environment project risk management provides benefi ts when it is implemented according to good practice principles and with organizational commitment to taking the decisions and performing actions in an open and unbiased manner 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 7 2 chapter 2 principles and concepts 21 introduction t his chapter introduces the key ideas required to understand and apply project risk management to projects following the approach described in chapter 11 of the p mbok guide fourth edition these principles and concepts are generally consistent with other approaches to project risk management commonly used although the terminology may differ in some details the execution of the project risk management process is dealt with in subsequent chapters of this practice standard and so is not discussed here 22 defi nition of project risk the word risk is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines its use in the p mbok g uide fourth edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process descriptions the defi nition of project risk given in the pmbok guide fourth edition is as follows p roject risk is an uncertain event or condition that if it occurs has a positive or a negative effect on a projects objectives t his defi nition includes two key dimensions of risk uncertainty and effect on a projects objectives when assessing the importance of a project risk these two dimensions must both be considered the uncertainty dimension may be described using the term probability and the effect may be called impact though other descriptors are possible such as likelihood and consequence t he defi nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described and more general conditions which are less specifi c but also may give risk to uncertainty t he defi nition of project risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a projects objectives as well as those which could have a positive effect these two types of risk are called respectively threats and opportunities it is important to address both threats and opportunities within a unifi ed project risk management process this allows for the gain of synergies and effi ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 9 2 chapter 2 principles and concepts r isks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur but which would matter if they did occur it is important to distinguish risks from riskrelated features such as cause and effect causes are events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise to risks effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project objectives if the associated risk occurs the causeriskeffect chain can be used in a structured risk statement or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described see section 53 when a risk event occurs it ceases to become uncertain threats which occur may be called issues or problems opportunities which occur may be called benefi ts both issuesproblems and benefi ts entail project management actions that are outside the scope of the project risk management process 23 individual risks and overall project risk it is useful to consider project risk at two levels individual risks and overall project risk i ndividual risks are specifi c events or conditions that might affect project objectives an individual risk may positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives elements or tasks understanding individual risks can assist in determining how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project success daytoday project risk management focuses on these individual risks in order to enhance the prospects of a successful project outcome o verall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole overall project risk is more than the sum of individual risks on a project since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual elements or tasks it represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome it is an important component of strategic decisionmaking program and portfolio management and project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set at these higher levels it is necessary to set realistic targets for the cost and duration of a project establish the contingency reserve levels required to protect the project stakeholders set appropriate project priorities and judge whether the risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances 24 stakeholder risk attitudes t he risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall project risk matters a wide range of factors infl uence risk attitude these include the scale of the project within the range of stakeholders overall activities the strength of public commitments made about the performance of the project and the stakeholders sensitivity to issues such as environmental impacts industrial relations and other factors stakeholder risk attitudes usually result in a desire for increased certainty in project outcomes and may express a preference for one project objective over another how risk is regarded is usually also strongly infl uenced by an organizations culture different organizations are more or less open and this often impacts the way risk management can be applied 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 10 2 chapter 2 principles and concepts understanding stakeholders attitudes toward risk is an important component of risk management planning that precedes risk identifi cation and analysis in order to optimize both project success and stakeholder satisfaction with the projects results these attitudes should be identifi ed and managed proactively and deliberately throughout the project risk management process they may differ from one project to another for the same stakeholders and will usually differ from one group of stakeholders to another in fact a single stakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes at various stages in the same project i t is also important to understand the particular implications of stakeholder risk attitudes on projects where the team is international crossindustry or multiorganizational 25 iterative process it is the nature of projects that circumstances change as they are being planned and executed the amount of information available about risks will usually increase as time goes on some risks will occur while others will not new risks will arise or be discovered and the characteristics of those already identifi ed may change as a result the project risk management processes should be repeated and the corresponding plans progressively elaborated throughout the lifetime of the project t o ensure that project risk management remains effective the identifi cation and analysis of risks should be revisited periodically the progress on risk response actions should be monitored and the action plans adjusted accordingly if external circumstances change signifi cantly it may also be necessary to revisit the risk management planning process the development of an initial risk management plan and risk assessment is the start of the process not the end the frequency and depth of reviews and updates will depend on the nature of the project the volatility of the environment in which the project is being implemented and the timing of other project management reviews and updates 26 communication p roject risk management cannot take place in isolation success relies heavily on communication throughout the process r isk identifi cation and analysis depend on comprehensive input from stakeholders in a project to ensure that nothing signifi cant is overlooked and that risks are realistically assessed the credibility of the process and the commitment of those who should act to manage risks can be assured only if the way the process operates and the conclusions it produces are understood and seen as credible by all concerned this demands effective and honest communication from the project risk management process to the rest of the project team and other project stakeholders communication of the results of the project risk management process should be targeted to meet the specifi c needs of each stakeholder and should be refl ected within the overall project communications strategy with each stakeholders responsibility and role in risk management identifi ed and agreedupon 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 11 2 chapter 2 principles and concepts 27 responsibility for project risk management it may be considered simplistic to say risk management is everyones responsibility as previously stated however it is important that management of project risk is not left to a few risk specialists project risk management should be included as an integral part of all other project processes since project risks can affect project objectives anyone with an interest in achieving those objectives should play a role in project risk management the specifi c roles depend on the project team members and other stakeholders place within the project and their relation to project objectives roles and responsibilities for project risk management should be clearly defi ned and communicated and individuals should be held responsible and accountable for results this includes allocating responsibility for specifi c activities within the risk process as well as for resulting actions required to implement agreedupon responses responsibility should also be allocated for ensuring that riskrelated lessons are captured for future use 28 project managers role for project risk management the project manager has particular responsibilities in relation to the project risk management process the project manager has overall responsibility for delivering a successful project which fully meets the defi ned objectives the project manager is accountable for the daytoday management of the project including effective risk management the role of the project manager may include cid129 encouraging senior management support for project risk management activities cid129 determining the acceptable levels of risk for the project in consultation with stakeholders cid129 developing and approving the risk management plan cid129 promoting the project risk management process for the project cid129 facilitating open and honest communication about risk within the project team and with management and other stakeholders cid129 participating in all aspects of the project risk management process cid129 approving risk responses and associated actions prior to implementation cid129 applying project contingency funds to deal with identifi ed risks that occur during the project cid129 overseeing risk management by subcontractors and suppliers cid129 r egularly reporting risk status to key stakeholders with recommendations for appropriate strategic decisions and actions to maintain acceptable risk exposure cid129 escalating identifi ed risks to senior management where appropriate such risks include any which are outside the authority or control of the project manager any which require input or action from outside the project and any for which the release of management reserve funds might be appropriate cid129 monitoring the effi ciency and effectiveness of the project risk management process cid129 auditing risk responses for their effectiveness and documenting lessons learned 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 12 3 chapter 3 introduction to project risk management processes 31 project risk management and project management all projects are uncertain uncertainty is inevitable since projects are unique and temporary undertakings based on assumptions and constraints delivering project results to multiple stakeholders with different requirements project management can be seen as an attempt to control this uncertain environment through the use of structured and disciplined techniques such as estimating planning cost control task allocation earned value analysis monitoring and review meetings etc each of these elements of project management has a role in defi ning or controlling the uncertainty which is inherent in all projects p roject risk management provides an approach by which uncertainty can be understood assessed and managed within projects as such it forms an integral part of project management and effective project risk management is a critical success factor for project success f or project management to be fully effective however it is important that project risk management is not viewed as an optional process or performed as an additional overhead task since many elements of project management address inherent uncertainty the interface between structured project risk management and the other processes of project management needs to be clear the outputs of project risk management should be taken into account within many of the project management processes they can for example impact estimating resource requirements cost or duration assessing the impact of proposed scope changes planning or replanning the forward strategy of the project allocating resources to tasks and reporting progress to stakeholders n one of these actions can be performed properly without a clear view of the risk involved as determined during the project risk management process in other words project management process effectiveness is increased by using the information and results from project risk management i n addition effective project risk management requires input from other project management processes outputs such as the work breakdown structure wbs estimates the project schedule assumptions list etc are all important prerequisites for effective project risk management 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 13 3 chapter 3 introduction to project risk management processes 32 project risk management processes the defi ned steps of project risk management describe a structured approach for understanding and managing risk on a project this chapter outlines the steps required for effective project risk management each step is described in more detail in subsequent chapters as previously defi ned project risk is an uncertain event or condition that if it occurs has a positive or negative effect on a projects objectives from this defi nition it is clear that risks only exist in relation to objectives it is therefore essential at the start of the project risk management process to clearly defi ne the objectives it is also clear that different projects are exposed to different levels of risk so each step in the project risk management process should be scalable to meet the varying degrees of risk scalable elements of the process include available resources methodology and processes used tools and techniques used supporting infrastructure review and update frequency and reporting requirements as a precondition for a successful project risk management implementation it is important to have a clear understanding of the risk thresholds that defi ne the key stakeholders views on acceptable levels of risk as well as a framework against which identifi ed risks can be assessed a s a result the project risk management process always starts with an initiation step this is required in order to ensure a common understanding and agreement of the team and other stakeholders on the approach and parameters that will be applied in managing risk in this project as well as the scope and objectives of the project risk management process itself project risk management activities resources and attention should be appropriate to the project since different projects warrant different levels of risk management application the main actions to provide the required tailoring are as follows defi ne those objectives against which risks will be identifi ed defi ne how the elements of the project risk management process will be scaled for this project and defi ne risk thresholds tolerances and the assessment framework t he outputs from this initial step should be documented communicated and then reviewed by the stakeholders to ensure a common understanding of the scope and objectives for the project risk management process the document should be formally approved at a senior level 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 14 3 chapter 3 introduction to project risk management processes o nce the project risk management scope and objectives are agreed upon it is possible to start identifying risks being careful to distinguish genuine risks from nonrisks such as causes effects problems issues etc a variety of risk identifi cation techniques is available each with its own strengths and weaknesses one or more techniques should be selected as appropriate for meeting the needs of the specifi c project the aim is to expose and document all knowable risks recognizing that some risks will be inherently unknowable and others will emerge later in the project the emergent nature of risk requires the project risk management process to be iterative repeating the identify risks process in order to fi nd risks which were not evident earlier in the project input should be sought from a wide range of project stakeholders when identifying risks since each will have a different perspective on the risks facing the project historical records and project documents should also be reviewed to identify risks for this project all identifi ed risks are recorded ideally a risk owner is designated for each identifi ed risk it is the responsibility of the risk owner to manage the corresponding risk through all of the subsequent project risk management processes following risk identifi cation it is necessary to evaluate the importance of each risk in order to prioritize individual risks for further attention evaluate the level of overall project risk and determine appropriate responses risk evaluation can be performed using qualitative techniques to address individual risks using quantitative techniques to consider the overall effect of risk on the project outcome or using both in combination these two approaches require different types of data but where both qualitative and quantitative techniques are used an integrated approach should be adopted qualitative techniques are used to gain a better understanding of individual risks considering a range of characteristics such as probability of occurrence degree of impact on project objectives manageability timing of possible impacts relationships with other risks common causes or effects etc understanding and prioritizing risks is an essential prerequisite to managing them so qualitative techniques are used on most projects the outputs from qualitative assessments should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and form a basis for determining appropriate responses q uantitative techniques provide insights into the combined effect of identifi ed risks on the project outcome these techniques take into account probabilistic or projectwide effects such as correlation between risks interdependency and feedback loops thereby indicating the degree of overall risk faced by the project the result is an indication of the degree of overall risk faced by the project the results of quantitative analysis should be used to focus the development of appropriate responses particularly the calculation of required contingency reserve levels and must be documented and communicated to inform subsequent actions quantitative techniques may not be required for all projects to ensure effective management of risk 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 15 3 chapter 3 introduction to project risk management processes o nce individual risks have been prioritized and the degree of overall project risk exposure is understood appropriate risk responses should be developed using an iterative process which continues until an optimal set of responses has been developed a range of possible response strategies exists for both threats and opportunities the risk owner should select a suitable strategy for each individual risk based on its characteristics and assessed priority ensuring that the strategy is achievable affordable cost effective and appropriate the use of a single strategy that addresses several related risks should be considered whenever possible the risk owner is responsible for defi ning actions to implement the chosen strategy these actions may be delegated to action owners as appropriate the risk owner should monitor actions to determine their effectiveness and also to identify any secondary risks which may arise because of the implementation of risk responses in addition to individual risk responses actions may be taken to respond to overall project risk all response strategies and actions should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and incorporated into the project plan i t is essential that agreedupon actions are implemented otherwise the risk exposure of the project remains unchanged it is also vital that the project risk management process be repeated at regular intervals throughout the life of the project this will enable the project team to reevaluate the status of previously identifi ed risks to identify emergent and secondary risks and to determine the effectiveness of the project risk management process the steps outlined previously form the project risk management process these are detailed in subsequent chapters as follows plan risk management chapter 4 defi nes the scope and objectives of the project risk management process and ensures that the risk process is fully integrated into wider project management identify risks chapter 5 identifi es as many knowable risks as

project risk management process flow diagram 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 17 4 chapter 4 plan risk management 41 purpose and objectives of the plan risk management process t he objectives of the plan risk management process are to develop the overall risk management strategy for the project to decide how the risk management processes will be executed and to integrate project risk management with all other project management activities e ffective risk management requires creation of a risk management plan this plan describes how the risk management processes should be carried out and how they fi t in with the other project management processes on a broader level it describes the relationships among project risk management general project management and the management processes in the rest of the organization to provide the greatest benefi t initial risk management planning should be carried out early in the overall planning of the project and the corresponding risk management activities integrated into the overall project management plan the risk management plan may subsequently need to be adapted as the needs of the project and its stakeholders become clearer or change although the project risk management processes form an integral part of the overall project management plan a budget in terms of resources cost and time for the specifi c risk management activities should be established in order to better track control and as necessary defend the corresponding expenditures throughout the project the cost of treating the risks themselves should be included appropriately in the project budget while the risk management plan should describe how this part of the project budget is evaluated allocated and managed the risk management plan will defi ne the monitoring methods to ensure that the corresponding expenditures are tracked appropriately as well as the conditions under which the approved budget for risk management can be modifi ed in the same way that project management is a process of progressive elaboration risk management activities need to be repeated throughout the project the risk management plan should defi ne both the normal frequency for repeating the processes as well as specifi c or exceptional conditions under which the corresponding actions should be initiated the corresponding risk management activities should be integrated into the project management plan there are two categories of success criteria for risk management those for success of the project in general and those for success of project risk management 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 19 4 chapter 4 plan risk management projectrelated criteria to assess the success of project risk management the stakeholders must agree on an acceptable level of results for the projectrelated criteria such as cost time and scope in order to ensure consistency and agreement among stakeholders the risk management plan should present these objectives with reference to the project defi nition documents to provide guidance in risk management particularly in prioritizing risk responses stakeholders should also prioritize each project objective processrelated criteria the measures for success in project risk management depend on a number of factors such as the inherent level of uncertainty of the project for example the project risk management process for a research project needs to address more unforeseen changes than for a project with a more predictable environment a research project risk management process may be considered a success even if it results in more variance from the baseline than would be allowable for a successful process in a more predictable project t he level of risk that is considered acceptable in a project depends on the risk attitudes of the relevant stakeholders the risk attitudes of both the organization and the stakeholders may be infl uenced by a number of factors all of which need to be identifi ed these include their inherent tolerance for uncertainty and the relative importance to them of achieving or missing specifi c project objectives the output of this analysis should then be taken into account for setting thresholds and providing weighting factors when applying the project risk management processes in the specifi c project guidelines and rules for escalating riskrelated information to management and other stakeholders should refl ect the risk attitudes and expectations of the corresponding stakeholders the project manager should maintain effective communication with the stakeholders as the project evolves in order to become aware of any changes in the stakeholders attitudes and adapt the risk management approach to take any new facts into account it is important that the participants share a common understanding of all terms used to describe the risks and that the critical values and thresholds that will serve as parameters for the tools should be defi ned in a manner consistent with the scope of the project and the attitudes of the stakeholders if qualitative analysis uses such terms as high impact or medium probability these should be defi ned objectively in the risk management plan similarly the risk management plan should specify any key numerical values required in quantitative analysis or for decisionmaking in risk response planning or risk monitoring and control r isk management planning should establish the type and level of risk detail to be addressed and provide a template of the risk register that will be used for recording riskrelated information the risk management plan should also indicate the intensity of effort and the frequency with which the various project risk management processes should be applied this depends on the characteristics of the project as well as on the specifi ed risk management objectives i n order for the project risk management processes to be carried out correctly and effectively the project team and other stakeholders need to know where and when they will be expected to participate their criteria for determining success their level of authority and what action to take relative to actions or decisions beyond this level the risk management plan specifi es the projects risk management roles and responsibilities and defi nes the corresponding expectations for both senior management and project personnel 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 20 4 chapter 4 plan risk management r iskrelated communication occurs at two levels a within the project team and b between the project team and the other project stakeholders the principles for each of these categories of communication are defi ned in the risk management plan for the team the plan describes the frequency and scope of the various risk management meetings and reports required to carry out the corresponding project risk management processes as well as the structure and content of such meetings and reports for the other stakeholders the plan sets their expectations as to the structure content and frequency of routine documents to be received as well as the way in which information will be shared for escalation or exceptional events details of the information required by the project team from stakeholders should also be clearly defi ned 42 critical success factors for the plan risk management process t he principal criteria for a valid risk management plan are acceptance by the stakeholders alignment with the internal and external constraints on the project balance between cost or effort and benefi t and completeness with respect to the needs of the project risk management process critical success factors for the plan risk management process are detailed below 421 identify and address barriers to successful project risk management the time and effort required to carry out the plan risk management process will not be supported unless the stakeholders and especially management in the organization responsible for the project recognize and accept the benefi ts of managing risk and the added value of addressing this as a skill in its own right rather than as a passive or reactive component of general project management a clear defi nition of the project objectives and a highlevel view of the project environment and solution approach are required to provide a valid basis for risk management the project manager should therefore ensure that valid defi nition and planning information is available for the plan risk management activity a n organization inexperienced in risk management planning may need to develop its own approach and may expend an inappropriate amount of time and effort on this alternatively it may use a proprietary or preexisting approach which requires tailoring the availability of some or all of the following organizational process assets contributes to the chances of success of the plan risk management activities standard templates predefi ned risk categories and an established project management methodology incorporating risk management procedures that specify what risk information is required for decision making when it is required and a defi nition of concepts and terms roles responsibilities and authority levels access to relevant lessons learned at this stage will allow this experience to be taken into account from the start of the project the risk management plan will not deliver its value unless project risk management is carried out as an integral part of the project the corresponding activities should be built into the project work breakdown structure and included in the corresponding schedule budget and workassignment documents 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 21 4 chapter 4 plan risk management 422 involve project stakeholders in project risk management the project manager needs to involve the project stakeholders in the plan risk management activities to build on their skills and experience as well as to ensure their understanding of and commitment to the full project risk management process the provision for risk management resources specifi ed within the risk management plan should be approved by management at a level adequate for carrying out the required project risk management processes in accordance with agreedupon objectives management should be involved in the analysis of the level of resourcing required for managing project risk and accept the risks that may arise from specifi c limitations placed on the provision of resources disagreements between stakeholders in the areas of risk tolerance and evaluation measures should be addressed and resolved 423 comply with the organizations objectives policies and practices the feasibility of risk management planning is dependent upon the features of the organization in which it is carried out the rules and guidelines defi ned in the risk management plan should be compatible with the culture of the organization its capabilities from the point of view of people and facilities and its values goals and objectives p roject management in general and risk management in particular contribute to the organizations effective governance the risk management plan should identify and take into account the relevant organizational procedures and any other enterprise environmental factors that apply such as strategic risk management or corporate governance processes 43 tools and techniques for the plan risk management process 431 planning sessions p lanning sessions are recommended in order to build a common understanding of the projects risk approach between project stakeholders and to gain agreement on the techniques to be used for managing risk e laboration of the risk management plan often serves to develop an effective means for the team to work together since a similar consultative team approach will be used in subsequent stages of the risk management process the participants should include the project manager selected project team members and other stakeholders members of the broader organization having responsibility for risk and other subject matter experts or facilitators as needed at this point the initial risk responsibilities methodology templates terms defi nitions time schedules and cost budgets for the other project risk management processes should be assigned and accepted the specifi cation for the tools that will be used in subsequent processes should include all parameters and other inputs required to ensure their applicability to the specifi c project these should be documented in the risk management plan which when formally approved is the principal deliverable of the plan risk management process 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 22 4 chapter 4 plan risk management 432 templates in order to benefi t from experience and existing best practice risk management planning should take into account relevant existing templates for work products such as risk status reports risk breakdown structures or the risk register a decision should be made as to which templates are relevant to the project and these should then be adapted and included in the risk management plan 44 documenting the results of the plan risk management process t he results of risk management planning are documented in the risk management plan the plan serves to provide all project stakeholders with a common view of how the riskrelated activities of the project will be handled what has been agreed upon and a description of the stakeholders involvement and responsibilities in these activities an overview of the key areas of focus is given in figure 41 figure 41 key areas of focus for the plan risk management process depending upon the size and complexity of the project some or all of the following elements will be present in a risk management plan introduction project description risk management methodology risk management

communications plan strategy and risk breakdown structure 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 23 5 chapter 5 identify risks 51 purpose and objectives of the identify risks process a risk cannot be managed unless it is fi rst identifi ed consequently after risk management planning has been completed the fi rst process in the iterative project risk management process aims to identify all the knowable risks to project objectives i t is however impossible to identify all the risks at the outset of a project over time the level of project risk exposure changes as a result of the decisions and actions taken previously in the project internal change and of externally imposed change t he purpose of risk identifi cation is to identify risks to the maximum extent that is practicable the fact that some risks are unknowable or emergent requires the identify risk process to be iterative repeating the identify risks process to fi nd new risks which have become knowable since the previous iteration of the process w hen a risk is fi rst identifi ed potential responses may also be identifi ed at the same time these should be recorded during the identify risks process and considered for immediate action if such action is appropriate where such responses are not implemented immediately these should be considered during the plan risk responses process 52 critical success factors for the identify risks process the practices described in sections 521 through 5210 will maximize the value and effectiveness of the identify risks process and enhance the likelihood of identifying as many risks as practicable 521 early identifi cation r isk identifi cation should be performed as early as possible in the project lifecycle recognizing the paradox that uncertainty is high in the initial stages of a project so there is often less information on which to base the risk identifi cation early risk identifi cation enables key project decisions to take maximum account of risks inherent in the project and may result in changes to the project strategy it also maximizes the time available for development and implementation of risk responses which enhances effi ciency since responses taken early are often normally less costly than later ones 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 25 5 chapter 5 identify risks 522 iterative identifi cation since not all risks can be identifi ed at any given point in the project it is essential that risk identifi cation is repeated throughout the project life cycle this should be done periodically at a frequency determined during the plan risk management process risk identifi cation might also be repeated at key milestones in the project or whenever there is signifi cant change to the project or its operating environment 523 emergent identifi cation in addition to invoking the identify risks process as defi ned in the project plan the project risk management process should permit risks to be identifi ed at any time not limited to formal risk identifi cation events or regular reviews 524 comprehensive identifi cation a broad range of sources of risk should be considered to ensure that as many uncertainties as possible that might affect objectives have been identifi ed 525 explicit identifi cation of opportunities the identify risks process should ensure opportunities are properly considered 526 multiple perspectives t he identify risks process should take input from a broad range of project stakeholders to ensure that all perspectives are represented and considered limiting risk identifi cation to the immediate project team is unlikely to expose all knowable risks 527 risks linked to project objectives e ach identifi ed project risk should relate to at least one project objective time cost quality scope etc noting that the pmbok g uide defi nes risk as an uncertain event or condition that if it occurs has a positive or a negative effect on a projects objectives consideration of each project objective during the identify risks process will assist in identifying risks noting that some risks may affect more than one objective 528 complete risk statement i dentifi ed risks should be clearly and unambiguously described so that they can be understood by those responsible for risk assessment and risk response planning single words or phrases such as resources or logistics are inadequate and do not properly communicate the nature of the risk more detailed risk descriptions are required which explicitly state the uncertainty and its causes and effects 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 26 5 chapter 5 identify risks 529 ownership and level of detail r isks can be identifi ed at a number of levels of detail a generalized or highlevel description of risk can make it diffi cult to develop responses and assign ownership while describing risks in a lot of detail can create a great deal of work each risk should be described at a level of detail at which it can be assigned to a single risk owner with clear responsibility and accountability for its management trigger conditions should also be identifi ed where this is possible and appropriate 5210 objectivity all human activities are susceptible to bias especially when dealing with uncertainty both motivational biases where someone is trying to bias the result in one direction or another or cognitive biases where biases occur as people are using their best judgment and applying heuristics may occur this should be explicitly recognized and addressed during the identify risks process sources of bias should be exposed wherever possible and their effect on the risk process should be managed proactively the aim is to minimize subjectivity and allow open and honest identifi cation of as many risks as possible to the project 53 tools and techniques for the identify risks process a range of tools and techniques is available for risk identifi cation these fall into the following three categories as illustrated in figure 51 figure 51 three perspectives of risk identification 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 27 5 chapter 5 identify risks 531 historical review historical reviews are based on what occurred in the past either on this project or other similar projects in the same organization or comparable projects in other organizations historical review approaches rely on careful selection of comparable situations which are genuinely similar to the current project and fi ltering of data to ensure that only relevant previous risks are considered in each case the risks identifi ed in the selected historical situation should be considered asking whether they or similar risks might arise in this project 532 current assessments c urrent assessments rely on detailed consideration of the current project analyzing its characteristics against given frameworks and models in order to expose areas of uncertainty unlike historical review approaches current assessment techniques do not rely on outside reference points but are based purely on examination of the project 533 creativity techniques a wide range of creativity techniques can be used for risk identifi cation which encourages project stakeholders to use their imagination to fi nd risks which might affect the project the outcomes or effectiveness of these techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively these techniques can be used either singly or in groups and employ varying degrees of structure these techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively and their success is enhanced by use of a skilled facilitator e ach category of risk identifi cation technique has strengths and weaknesses and no single technique can be expected to reveal all knowable risks consequently the identify risks process for a particular project should use a combination of techniques perhaps selecting one from each category for example a project may choose to use a risk identifi cation checklist historical review together with assumptions analysis current assessment and brainstorming creativity use of a risk breakdown structure which organizes the categories of potential risks on the project a prompt list or a set of generic list categories may assist in ensuring that as many sources of risk as practicable have been addressed while recognizing that no such tools are complete nor can they replace original thinking 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 28 5 chapter 5 identify risks whichever risk identifi cation techniques are used it is important that identifi ed risks are unambiguously described in order to ensure that the project risk process is focused on the actual risks and not distracted or diluted by nonrisks use of structured risk descriptions can ensure clarity risk metalanguage offers a useful way of distinguishing a risk from its causes and effects describing each risk using threepart statements in the form as a result of cause risk may occur which would lead to effect the relationship between cause risk and effect is shown in figure 52 figure 52 cause risk and effect 54 documenting the results of the identify risks process t he results from the identify risks process should be recorded in order to capture all relevant information currently available for each identifi ed risk the main output from the identify risks process is the risk register this includes a properly structured risk description and the nominated risk owner for each risk and may also include information on the causes and effects of the risk trigger conditions and preliminary responses 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 29 6 chapter 6 perform qualitative risk analysis 61 purpose and objectives of the perform qualitative risk analysis process t he perform qualitative risk analysis process assesses and evaluates characteristics of individually identifi ed project risks and prioritizes risks based on agreedupon characteristics assessing individual risks using qualitative risk analysis evaluates the probability that each risk will occur and the effect of each individual risk on the project objectives as such it does not directly address the overall risk to project objectives that results from the combined effect of all risks and their potential interactions with each other this can however be achieved through use of quantitative risk analysis techniques see chapter 7 one step in the analysis is to categorize risks according to their sources or causes if several risks arise from a common source sometimes called a root cause risk responses may be more effective when they focus on addressing this root cause i dentifying common effects from groups of risks allows identifi cation of the areas of greatest risk exposure eg to the project completion date the budget or a particular deliverables scope facilitating risk response focus in these areas the methods of qualitative risk analysis are applied to the list of risks created or updated by the identify risks process to provide project management with the characteristics of the risks that have the most infl uence positive or negative on achieving the projects objectives risks that are assessed as high priority to either threaten or to enhance the achievement of project objectives will be an important focus in the plan risk responses process they may be further analyzed such as in the analysis of the overall project risk that is discussed in perform quantitative risk analysis process 62 critical success factors for the perform qualitative risk analysis process several factors that lead to successful qualitative risk analysis are described in sections 621 through 624 and summarized in figure 61 agreement of the project stakeholders is a fundamental criterion and a common theme the agreedupon approach is the foundation of process credibility then agreedupon defi nitions enable highquality information to be collected finally with these conditions in place the process can be executed reliably which contributes to the credibility of its outputs 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 31 6 chapter 6 perform qualitative risk analysis figure 6 1 building risk analysis credibility 621 use agreedupon approach t he process is based on an agreedupon approach to this assessment that is applied across all of the identifi ed risks in any project by the nature of project risk all risks may be assessed according to probability of occurrence and impact on individual objectives should the risk occur other factors may be considered in determining the importance of a risk as follows urgency proximity risks requiring near term responses may be considered more urgent to address indicators of urgency can include the lead time necessary to execute a risk response and the clarity of symptoms and warning signs also known as detectability that may trigger the response manageability some risks are not manageable and it would be a waste of resources to attempt to address them the project team may examine these and decide to go forward perhaps establishing a contingency reserve stop or rescope the project because these risks pose an unmanageable threat or an opportunity that should not be missed with high probability and consequences inform the customer of the risks and ask for a decision from their point of view i mpact external to the project a risk may increase in importance if it affects the enterprise beyond the project 622 use agreedupon defi nitions of risk terms t he risk assessment should be based on agreedupon defi nitions of important terms and those defi nitions should be used consistently when assessing each risk the use of defi nitions for example of levels of probability and of impact on objectives assists the providers of the information in giving realistic assessments for each risk and facilitates the communication of the results to management and other stakeholders 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 32 6 chapter 6 perform qualitative risk analysis 623 collect highquality information about risks c ollection of highquality information about risks is required often this information is not available in any historic database and should be gathered by interviews workshops and other means using expert judgment data gathered from individuals may be subject to reporting or intentional bias when this occurs the bias should be identifi ed and remedied where possible or a different unbiased source of information should be found and used 624 perform iterative qualitative risk analysis t he success of qualitative risk analysis is enhanced if the process is used periodically throughout the project it is impossible to know in advance all the risks that may occur in a project therefore the identify risks and perform qualitative analysis processes should be repeated periodically for individual risks the frequency of this effort will be planned in the plan risk management process but may also depend on events within the project itself 63 tools and techniques for the perform qualitative risk analysis process t he tools and techniques used for assessing individual risks will identify the risks that are important to the projects success this process is illustrated in figure 62 figure 62 the perform qualitative risk analysis process 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 33 6 chapter 6 perform qualitative risk analysis 631 select risk characteristics that defi ne risks importance q ualitative risk analysis tools provide ways to distinguish those risks that are important for response or further analysis from those that are less important the criteria that make a risk of interest to management are agreed upon in advance and implemented in the tools used output from qualitative risk analysis tools includes a listing of risks in priority order or in priority groups eg high moderate and low t he tools for qualitative risk analysis allow the organization or project stakeholders to specify those levels or combinations of risk characteristics that make a particular risk of interest to management most tools assess a risks importance from a combination of probability of occurrence and degree of impact on objectives 632 collect and analyze data a ssessment of individual risks is based on information collected about them therefore data collection and evaluation tools including interviews workshops and references to databases of prior projects require management support and attention it is important to protect against bias in data gathering which is important when relying on expert judgment for the information 633 prioritize risks by probability and impact on specifi c objectives s ome tools permit distinguishing a risks priority in terms of the affected objective this capability provides a list of risks that are important for any specifi c objective of interest to management this is useful since it is common for risks to have uneven impacts on various project objectives 634 prioritize risks by probability and impact on overall project there are reasons for constructing a measure of a specifi c risks importance to the entire project as contrasted with its importance to specifi c objectives a common reason is for ease of communication with management and other stakeholders when a single risk prioritization index is needed the organization should be explicit about how that index is created usually the index refl ects the organizations preference among objectives the technique for creating the overall risk priority measure should be documented in the plan risk management process 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 34 6 chapter 6 perform qualitative risk analysis 635 categorize risk causes categorizing risks appropriately may lead to improved analysis of the probability and magnitude of project risk and to effective responses understanding the relationships between risks may provide a better understanding of the possibility and magnitude of project risk than if risks are only considered as separate and independent events identifying common root causes of a group of risks for instance may reveal both the magnitude of the risk event for the group as a whole along with effective strategies that might address several risks simultaneously alternatively some risks may be linked with others in a causal chain and understanding the chain of risks may lead to a better understanding of the implication of risk for the project identifying risks that can occur at the same time or using the same resources for recovery might provide a realistic picture of problems of risk mitigation using scarce resources combining the results of the perform qualitative risk analysis process with the risk breakdown structure see identify risks chapter 5 can show clusters of priority risks arising from specifi c sources a combination of the risk analysis information with the work breakdown structure wbs can show which areas of the project exhibit the most risk assessing the highpriority risks impact on one objective such as the schedule may indicate which activities to address to reduce that objectives uncertainty all of these approaches can contribute to the realism and usefulness of the qualitative risk analysis 636 document the results of the perform qualitative risk analysis process t he perform qualitative risk analysis process adds structure to the list of undifferentiated risks see identify risks chapter 5 into categories of priority priorities are usually based on the risks probability of occurring and its potential impact on specifi c project objectives or on the whole project each identifi ed risk is assigned a priority perhaps by objective or for the entire project this information is usually stored in the risk register which is easy to use and update with new information the risk register list of prioritized risks is posted to the project participants who are responsible for further analysis or action to improve the project plan risks that are judged to have high priority are segregated for further analysis and response planning and are generally monitored frequently risks of low priority to the project may be placed on a watch list and are reviewed less often for changes in their status 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 35 7 chapter 7 perform quantitative risk analysis 71 purpose and objectives of the perform quantitative risk analysis process the perform quantitative risk analysis process provides a numerical estimate of the overall effect of risk on the objectives of the project based on current plans and information when considering risks simultaneously results from this type of analysis can be used to evaluate the likelihood of success in achieving project objectives and to estimate contingency reserves usually for time and cost that are appropriate to both the risks and the risk tolerance of project stakeholders i t is generally accepted that analyzing uncertainty in the project using quantitative techniques such as monte carlo simulation may provide more realism in the estimate of the overall project cost or schedule than a nonprobabilistic approach which assumes that the activity durations or lineitem cost estimates are deterministic however it should be recognized that quantitative risk analysis is not always required or appropriate for all projects for example qualitative risk analysis may provide enough information for development of effective risk responses especially for smaller projects therefore during the plan risk management process the benefi ts of quantitative risk analysis should be weighed against the effort required to ensure that the additional insights and value justify the additional effort p artial risk analyses such as qualitative risk analysis aim at prioritizing individual risks viewed one at a time and therefore cannot produce measures of overall project risk when all risks are considered simultaneously calculating estimates of overall project risk is the focus of the perform quantitative risk analysis process s pecifi c project risks are usually best understood and quantifi ed at a detailed level such as the lineitem cost or schedule activity level by contrast project objectives such as achievement of the projects budget or the schedule are specifi ed at a higher level often at the level of the total project an overall risk analysis such as one that uses quantitative techniques estimates the implication of all quantifi ed risks on project objectives the implementation of overall risk analysis using quantitative methods requires complete and accurate representation of the project objectives built up from individual project elements examples of these representations include the project schedule or cost estimate identifying risks on individual project elements such as schedule activities or lineitem costs at a level of detail that lends itself to specifi c assessment of individual risks including generic risks that have a broader effect than individual project elements applying a quantitative method such as monte carlo simulation or decision tree analysis that incorporates multiple risks simultaneously in determining overall impact on the overall project objective 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 37 7 chapter 7 perform quantitative risk analysis r esults of the quantitative analysis will be compared to the project plan baseline or current to give management an estimate of the overall project risk and will answer important questions such as what is the probability of meeting the projects objectives how much contingency reserve eg reserves or buffers of time resources and cost is needed to provide the organization with the level of certainty it requires based upon its risk tolerance w hat are those parts of the project such as lineitem costs or schedule activities which contribute the most risk when all risks are considered simultaneously which individual risks contribute the most to overall project risk estimating overall project risk using quantitative methods helps distinguish those projects where quantifi ed risks threaten objectives beyond the tolerance of the stakeholders from those for which the objectives are within acceptable tolerances even when risk is considered the former may be targeted for vigorous risk responses aimed at protecting those objectives most important to the stakeholders a highlevel comparison of quantitative and qualitative risk analysis processes is presented in figure 71 figure 71 comparison of qualitative and quantitative approaches 72 critical success factors for the perform quantitative risk analysis process success in achieving the objectives of quantitative risk analysis depends explicitly on at least the factors described in sections 721 through 726 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 38 7 chapter 7 perform quantitative risk analysis 721 prior risk identifi cation and qualitative risk analysis t he perform quantitative risk analysis process occurs after the identify risks and perform qualitative risk analysis processes have been completed reference to a prioritized list of identified risks ensures that the perform quantitative risk analysis process will consider all significant risks when analyzing their effects quantitatively 722 appropriate project model a n appropriate model of the project should be used as the basis for quantitative risk analysis project models most frequently used in quantitative risk analysis include the project schedule for time lineitem cost estimates for cost decision tree for decisions in the face of uncertainty and other totalproject models quantitative risk analysis is especially sensitive to the completeness and correctness of the model of the project that is used 723 commitment to collecting highquality risk data o ften highquality data about risks are not available in any historic database and should be gathered by interviews workshops and other means using expert judgment of those present collection of risk data requires resources and time as well as management support 724 unbiased data s uccess in gathering risk analysis data requires the ability to recognize when biases occur and combating that bias or developing other unbiased sources of the data bias in risk data can occur for many reasons but two common sources of bias are cognitive bias and motivational bias 725 overall project risk derived from individual risks the perform quantitative risk analysis process is based upon a methodology that correctly derives the overall project risk from the individual risks in risk analysis of cost and schedule for example an appropriate method is monte carlo simulation a decision tree is an appropriate method for making decisions when future events are not certain using the probability and impact of all risks and combining their effect to derive an overall project measure such as value or cost in each of these methods the risks are specifi ed at the level of the detailed tasks or lineitem costs and incorporated into the model of the project to calculate effects on objectives such as schedule or cost for the entire project by combining those risks 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 39 7 chapter 7 perform quantitative risk analysis 726 interrelationships between risks in quantitative risk analysis attention should be given to the possibility that the individual risks in the project model are related to each other for example several risks may have a common root cause and therefore are likely to occur together this possibility is sometimes addressed by correlating the risks that are related ensuring that they generally occur together during the analysis another common way to represent the risks which occur together is by using the risk register listing of the risk or root cause and attaching it to several project elements such as schedule activities or cost elements when a particular risk occurs the affected elements will all experience the effect of that risk together 73 tools and techniques for the perform quantitative risk analysis process t ools and techniques used appropriately for quantitative risk analysis have several characteristics as follows 731 comprehensive risk representation risk models permit representation of many if not all of the risks that have impact on an objective simultaneously they also permit the representation of both opportunities and threats to the projects objectives 732 risk impact calculation q uantitative models facilitate the correct calculation of the effect of many risks which are typically identifi ed and quantifi ed at a level of detail below the total project on the project objectives which are typically described at the level of the total project 733 quantitative method appropriate to analyzing uncertainty probability models use a quantitative method that addresses uncertainty specifi cally the methods should be able to handle the way uncertainty is represented predominantly as probability of an events occurring or as probability distributions for a range of outcomes a good example of this is the use of monte carlo simulation tools that permit the combination of probability distributions of lineitem costs or schedule activity durations many of which are uncertain 734 data gathering tools d ata gathering tools used in this process include assessment of historical data and workshops interviews or questionnaires to gather quantifi ed informationfor example on the probability of a risk occurring a probability distribution of its potential impacts on cost or time or relationships such as correlation between risks 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 40 7 chapter 7 perform quantitative risk analysis 735 effective presentation of quantitative analysis results r esults from the quantitative tools are generally not available in standard deterministic project management methods such as project scheduling or cost estimating examples of these are the probability distribution of project completion dates or total costs and the expected value of a project decision these results when all risks are considered simultaneously include the following probability of achieving a project objective such as fi nishing on time or within budget a mount of contingency reserve in cost time or resources needed to provide a required level of confi dence i dentity or location within the project model of the most important risks an example of this is a sensitivity analysis in a cost risk analysis or a criticality analysis in a schedule risk analysis the elements of a quantitative risk analysis are illustrated in figure 72 figure 72 structure of a quantitative risk analysis 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 41 7 chapter 7 perform quantitative risk analysis 736 iterative quantitative risk analysis the success of the perform quantitative risk analysis process is enhanced if the process is used periodically throughout the project it is impossible to know in advance all of the risks that may occur in a project often quantitative risk analysis should be repeated as the project proceeds the frequency of this effort will be determined during the plan risk management process but will also depend on events within the project itself see monitor and control risks chapter 9 737 information for response planning o verall project contingency reserve in time and cost should be refl ected in the projects schedule and budget quantitative risk analysis provides information that may be used to modify the project plan if the overall risk to time and cost indicates that an adjustment in scope is needed the scope changes are agreed upon and documented and a new quantitative risk analysis is carried out to refl ect the new aspects of the project 74 documenting the results of the perform quantitative risk analysis process the contingency reserves calculated in quantitative project cost and schedule risk analysis are incorporated respectively into the cost estimate and the schedule to establish a prudent target and a realistic expectation for the project contingency reserves may also be established to provide for the capture of opportunities that are judged to be priorities for the project if the contingency reserve required exceeds the time or resources available changes in the project scope and plan may result a lso the results of the analysis may provide more or less urgency to risk response see plan risk responses chapter 8 depending on the probability of achieving the plans objectives or the amount of contingency reserve required to provide the necessary level of confi dence the results of a quantitative risk analysis are recorded and passed on to the person andor group responsible for project management within the organization for any further actions required to make full use of these results 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 42 8 chapter 8 plan risk responses t he plan risk responses process determines effective response actions that are appropriate to the priority of the individual risks and to the overall project risk it takes into account the stakeholders risk attitudes and the conventions specifi ed in the risk management plan in addition to any constraints and assumptions that were determined when the risks were identifi ed and analyzed 81 purpose and objectives of the plan risk responses process t he objective of the plan risk responses process is to determine the set of actions which most enhance the chances of project success while complying with applicable organizational and project constraints once risks have been identifi ed analyzed and prioritized plans should be developed for addressing every risk the project team considers to be suffi ciently important either because of the threat it poses to the project objectives or the opportunity it offers the planning entails agreeing upon the actions to be taken and the potential changes to budget schedule resources and scope which these actions might cause contingent risk response actions need to be executed at the optimum time for this reason the response specifi cation for each such risk should include a description of any corresponding trigger conditions t he responsibility for monitoring the project conditions and implementing the corresponding actions should be clearly assigned every risk should have been allocated to a risk owner as part of the identify risks process and each of the corresponding risk responses should now be assigned to a specifi c risk action owner the risk owner is responsible for ensuring that the risk response is effective and for planning additional risk responses if required whereas the risk action owner is responsible for ensuring that the agreedupon risk responses are carried out as planned in a timely manner the role of the risk owner and that of the risk action owner may be assigned to a single person r esponses when implemented can have potential effects on the project objectives and as such can generate additional risks these are known as secondary risks and have to be analyzed and planned for in the same way as those risks which were initially identifi ed i t is never feasible or even desirable to eliminate all threats from a project similarly there is also a limit to the extent to which opportunities can be proactively managed there may be residual risks that will remain after the responses have been implemented these residual risks should be clearly identifi ed analyzed documented and communicated to all relevant stakeholders 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 43 8 chapter 8 plan risk responses a ll the approved unconditional actions arising from risk response planning should be integrated into the project management plan in order to ensure that they are carried out as part of normal project implementation the corresponding organizational and project management rules should also be invoked including the following cid129 project change management and confi guration control cid129 project planning budgeting and scheduling cid129 resource management and cid129 project communication planning 82 critical success factors for the plan risk responses process a range of factors are important for the success of the plan risk responses process these are described in sections 821 through 828 and shown in figure 81 figure 81 critical success factors for risk response planning 8 21 communicate communication with the various stakeholders should be maintained in an open and appropriate manner the resulting plans are disseminated and approval obtained in order to ensure full acceptance by all stakeholders i n addition if organizational causes of risks such as culture attitudes or disagreements concerning objectives are present they should be addressed openly this may require involving high levels of the organizations management and other stakeholders 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 44 8 chapter 8 plan risk responses 822 clearly defi ne riskrelated roles and responsibilities the risk response success will be dependent upon the full support and involvement of the project team and other stakeholders the key roles for project risk management are those of risk owner and risk action owner a single risk owner should be assigned to every identifi ed risk and each agreedupon risk response should have a single risk action owner the people with the corresponding responsibilities should be aware of what is expected of them and the other project stakeholders should understand and accept the needs and authority of these roles management may take ownership of risks with political organizational causes in addition senior management should approve and track associated riskrelated contingency reserves 823 specify timing of risk responses agreedupon responses should be integrated into the project management plan and will therefore be scheduled and assigned for execution the responses that depend on uncertain conditions should also be monitored so as to be performed if the conditions warrant them 824 provide resources budget and schedule for responses e ach response should be planned in detail in accordance with the methodology of the project and integrated into the project management plan this entails estimating the resources costs and duration updating the budget and schedule obtaining approval from management and obtaining commitment from the risk owners and risk action owners managements role at this stage is vital for supporting the project manager in developing risk responses and authorizing the corresponding resources 825 address the interaction of risks and responses r esponses may be developed to address risks related either by cause and effect or by common root cause categorization of risks for example by using tools such as the risk breakdown structure affi nity diagram or other categorizing tools may help identify and address this situation there is also a need during the plan risk responses process to consider the risks aggregated during the perform quantitative risk analysis process eg ten small related risks combined may pose a big risk to the project and then to develop generic responses where possible another interaction effect that may occur is when one risk if it occurs may affect the probability or impact of other risks deciding on the response strategy may require a compromise since some proposed responses may be mutually exclusive or counterproductive for example mitigating a threat to time could cost money thereby increasing pressure on the budget risk response planning also needs to take a holistic view of all proposed responses and make sure they are coherent 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 45 8 chapter 8 plan risk responses the challenge therefore in planning responses to risks is the need to control the potential effects of the strategy developed for treating the original risk if this is overlooked the total level of threat in a project can actually increase or the potential for opportunities can be compromised 826 ensure appropriate timely effective and agreedupon responses i n general responses should be appropriate timely costeffective feasible achievable agreedupon assigned and accepted any proposed risk response plan needs to be assessed against the following criteria cid129 consistency with organizational values project objectives and stakeholder expectations cid129 technical feasibility cid129 ability of the project team or risk action owners outside the project to carry out the corresponding actions and cid129 balance between overall impact of the response on the project objectives and the improvement in the risk profi le of the project 827 address both threats and opportunities risk response planning should combine responses that address the threats as well as those that provide for opportunities into a single integrated plan if either threats or opportunities are not fully addressed the combined set of response strategies will be incomplete and may even be invalid 828 develop strategies before tactical responses risk response planning should be carried out in an openminded manner rather than adopting the fi rst response that seems to be feasible the responses should be planned at a general strategic level and the strategy validated and agreed upon prior to developing the detailed tactical approach once the responses have been planned at a strategic level they should be expanded into actions at the tactical level and integrated into the project management plan eg schedule budget and resource assignments this activity may generate additional secondary risks which will need to be addressed at this time 83 risk response strategies t he project manager should develop risk response strategies for individual risks sets of risks and project level risks an overview of the steps in arriving at a complete set of responses is given in figure 82 t he affected stakeholders should be involved in determining the strategies once the strategies have been selected they need to be agreed upon by the entity that approves those strategies there are four strategies which address individual risks for threats and opportunities as described in sections 831 through 834 see also fig 82 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 46 8 chapter 8 plan risk responses 831 avoid a threat or exploit an opportunity t his strategy involves taking the actions required to address a threat or an opportunity in order to ensure either that the threat cannot occur or can have no effect on the project or that the opportunity will occur and the project will be able to take advantage of it 832 transfer a threat or share an opportunity this strategy entails transference to a third party that is better positioned to address a particular threat or opportunity 833 mitigate a threat or enhance an opportunity m itigation and enhancement are the most widely applicable and widely used response strategies here the approach is to identify actions that will decrease the probability andor the impact of a threat and increase the probability andor the impact of an opportunity 834 accept a threat or an opportunity this strategy applies when the other strategies are not considered applicable or feasible acceptance entails taking no action unless the risk actually occurs in which case contingency or fallback plans may be developed ahead of time to be implemented if the risk presents itself 835 applying risk response strategies to overall project risk in addition to responding to individual risks the four risk response strategies can be applied to address overall project risk as follows cid129 cancel the project as a last resort if the overall level of risk remains unacceptable cid129 set up a business structure in which the customer and the supplier share the risk cid129 replan the project or change the scope and boundaries of the project for example by modifying the project priority resource allocations delivery calendar etc cid129 pursue the project despite a risk exposure that exceeds the desired level 84 tools and techniques for the plan risk responses process there are four categories of tools and techniques as follows cid129 creativity tools to identify potential responses cid129 decisionsupport tools for determining the optimal potential response cid129 strategy implementation techniques designed to turn a strategy into action and cid129 tools to transfer control to the monitor and control risks process 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 47 8 chapter 8 plan risk responses t hese categories of tools can be used respectively to identify potential responses select the most appropriate response translate strategy into planning and assign the corresponding actions the steps involved in planning risk responses are shown in figure 82 841 response identifi cation risk response planning builds on the available information about the potential risks and aims to determine the optimal set of responses for this reason it should involve subject matter experts and employ creativity techniques in order to explore all of the options project planning and execution techniques are then required to evaluate the potential effects of the various options on the projects objectives 842 response selection once the set of potential responses for the risks being addressed is established decisionsupport techniques may need to be applied to select the best possible subset from these responses the selection process should take into account the cost of the responses the impact on the project objectives uncertainty of outcomes and the possible secondary and residual risks the identify risks perform quantitative risk analysis and plan risk responses processes may then need to be applied to the resultant project management plan and the residual and secondary risks that it would entail this iterative approach continues until all of the individual risks are deemed acceptable and the overall risk is within a predefi ned threshold 843 action planning project planning tools are used to turn the chosen strategies into concrete actions and to integrate these into existing plans the corresponding actions may be unconditional ie integrated into the project management plan or contingent on a trigger condition and predefi ned as a contingency response strategy 844 ownership and responsibility assignment t he project manager needs to use resource assignment processes to ensure the availability of an owner for each risk and for each response action so that each associated risk is managed and each corresponding risk response is carried out in a timely and effective manner to enable risk monitoring to identify the imminence or actual occurrence of the corresponding event every contingency response strategy should include a set of trigger conditions the responsibility for monitoring these conditions should be clearly assigned in the plan risk responses process and managed in the monitor and control risks process 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 48 8 chapter 8 plan risk responses the strategic defi nition of risk responses should include measurable criteria for success of the response risk action owners should monitor their assigned risks take agreedupon actions as required and provide the risk owners with relevant information on status or changes to the risk characteristics risk owners should assess the effectiveness of any actions decide whether additional actions are required and keep the project manager informed of the situation figure 82 the steps involved in planning risk responses 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 49 8 chapter 8 plan risk responses 85 documenting the results of the plan risk responses process r isk response planning is based on the information placed in the risk register during execution of the identify risks and perform analysis processes the corresponding risk response information is often referred to as the risk response plan although it may in fact be an integral part of the risk register 851 add risk responses to the risk register t he responserelated information for each risk is recorded in the risk register and updated regularly any interested stakeholder should be able to rapidly access all the information required to verify their responsibilities and manage the risk in accordance with the risk response plan the set of residual risks and their priorities are clearly identifi ed and recorded 852 add corresponding risk responses to the project management plan w hile developing the detailed set of risk responses the projectrelated implications are evaluated for inclusion in a modifi ed project management plan these include costs resource assignments scheduling details and changes to project documentation until these changes are formally approved along with the additional risks that they may carry risk response planning cannot be considered complete 853 review and document predicted exposure o nce the risk responses have been defi ned and integrated into the project management plan the individual and overall residual risks related to this plan are evaluated in order to determine whether additional response planning is required as shown in figure 82 this evaluation should provide an estimate of both the expected postresponse situation and the potential improvement of the risk exposure assuming that the proposed responses are effective the evaluation should be documented 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 50 9 chapter 9 monitor and control risks the effectiveness of project risk management depends upon the way the approved plans are carried out these plans should be executed correctly reviewed and updated regularly if this is carried out correctly the invested effort will be rewarded and future projects will benefi t from this projects experience 91 purpose and objectives of the monitor and control risks process t he primary objectives of risk monitoring and controlling are to track identifi ed risks monitor residual risks identify new risks ensure that risk response plans are executed at the appropriate time and evaluate their effectiveness throughout the project life cycle i n addition to tracking and managing the risk response actions the effectiveness of all of the project risk management processes should be reviewed to provide improvements to the management of the current project as well as future ones f or each risk or set of risks for which a contingent response has been defi ned the corresponding set of trigger conditions should have been specifi ed it is the responsibility of the action owner to ensure that these conditions are effectively monitored and that the corresponding actions are carried out as defi ned in a timely manner once the plan risk responses process is complete all of the approved unconditional response actions should have been included and defi ned in the current project management plan the fi rst action of risk monitoring and controlling is to check whether this is the case and take any appropriate action if necessary such as invoking the change management process with respect to any missing actions this will then ensure that the agreedupon actions are carried out within the normal project execution framework the risk owners and risk action owners need to be briefed on any changes that may affect their responsibilities effective communication needs to be maintained between them and the project manager so that the designated stakeholders accept accountability for controlling the potential outcomes of specifi c risks apply their best efforts to track the associated trigger conditions and carry out the agreedupon responses in a timely manner i n addition to the response actions and trigger conditions a mechanism for measuring the effectiveness of the response is provided by the plan risk responses process the risk action owner should keep the risk owner aware of the status of the response actions so that the risk owner can decide when the risk has been effectively dealt with or whether additional actions need to be planned and implemented 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 51 9 chapter 9 monitor and control risks as the project progresses additional information becomes available and the project environment may change as some risks occur whether foreseen or unforeseen and others become or cease to be relevant the planning should therefore be kept current and the project manager should ensure that periodic risk reassessment including risk identifi cation analysis and response planning is repeated at reasonable intervals or in response to project eventswithout generating excessive administrative overhead typical reasons for risk reassessment are occurrence of a major or unexpected risk need to analyze a complex change request phase end review project replanning or major plan elaboration and periodic review to ensure that the information remains current i n the event of major organizational changes risk management planning may need to be revisited prior to reassessing the risks in addition to the regular status reviews periodic audits should be performed to determine strengths and weaknesses in handling risks within the project this should entail identifying any barriers to effectiveness or keys to success in risk management recognition of which could lead to improvements in risk management of the current or future projects at the end of the project an integrated analysis of the risk management process should be carried out with a focus on longterm process improvements this analysis consolidates the fi ndings of the periodic audits to identify lessons that would be applicable in general to a large proportion of the organizations projects in the future such as appropriate levels of resources adequate time for the analysis use of tools level of detail etc at project closure the project manager should ensure that a description has been given of the closure of every risk in the risk register for example a did not occur b occurred and contingency plan invoked or c occurred and impact to the project scope ie time cost and quality t he output of the audit of the risk management process should be consolidated with specifi c information with respect to the projects experience of risks and any generally applicable guidelines for the organization should be highlighted and potential actions proposed for applying them this can lead to an update to the corresponding organizational process assets an overview of the steps involved in the monitor and control risks process is given in figure 91 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 52 9 chapter 9 monitor and control risks figure 91 schematic representation of the monitor and control risks process 92 critical success factors for the monitor and control risks process c ritical success factors relate to maintaining risk awareness throughout the project and include the characteristics and capabilities detailed in sections 921 through 923 921 integrate risk monitoring and control with project monitoring and control from the start the project management plan should include the actions required to monitor and control project risk this should be set up early in the project planning cycle and then adjusted in view of the risk response planning decisions adding for example the actions associated with monitoring specifi c conditions or metrics once risk response planning has been carried out the project schedule should include all of the agreedupon responserelated actions so that they can be carried out as a normal part of project execution and tracked accordingly 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 53 9 chapter 9 monitor and control risks 922 continuously monitor risk trigger conditions r isk response planning will have defi ned a set of actions to be carried out as part of the project schedule as well as actions whose execution is dependent on a predefi ned trigger condition checking for specifi cally defi ned risks that may trigger conditional responses is the responsibility of the risk action owner in close collaboration with the risk owner under the overall authority of the project manager 923 maintain risk awareness risk management reports should be a regular item on every status meeting agenda to ensure that all team members remain aware of the importance of risk management and to ensure that it is fully integrated into all of the project management decisions the projects seniorlevel sponsor should require regular reports on the risks and the planned responses to ensure that stakeholders are aware of the importance of keeping a focus on risk sponsor feedback also motivates the project team by demonstrating seniorlevel interest in project risk management s takeholders perception of the effectiveness of risk management is conditioned in part by the way in which risks are handled as they occur and by the number or characteristics of such events it is therefore crucial whenever a risk occurs that information about the event as well as the progress and effectiveness of the responses be communicated at regular intervals and in an honest manner adapted to the needs of each stakeholder this should be supported by a wellexecuted communications plan 93 tools and techniques for the monitor and control risks process in addition to standard project management monitoring and control capabilities risk monitoring and controlling requires a focus on the tools which will support its key success factors for tracking overall risk as well as individual risks 931 managing contingency reserves reserves may have been allocated separately to cover timerelated and costrelated risks techniques are required that allow the project manager to assess at any point in the project whether these provide the required level of confi dence in the success of the project tools for managing time buffers should be closely integrated into the projects scheduling techniques whereas those for managing cost should be compatible with the fi nancial practices tools are required to identify trends and forecast future outcomes to determine whether the reserves will remain suffi cient tools are also required for tracking progress and spending in a consolidated manner 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 54 9 chapter 9 monitor and control risks 932 tracking trigger conditions t rigger conditions and the corresponding metrics are defi ned during the plan risk responses process tools are required to evaluate and track these conditions against the project baseline or specifi ed thresholds based on actual status they can be chosen to provide information on risks related to the deliverables such as performance as well as on projectrelated features such as time and cost 933 tracking overall risk tools are required in order to determine as the project progresses whether the responses are having the expected effect on the projects overall level of risk 934 tracking compliance i n order to monitor the quality of the execution of the riskrelated plans and processes a set of quality metrics such as degree of variation from the baseline should be tracked and recorded these metrics will normally have been defi ned in the risk management plan 94 documenting the results of the monitor and control risks process t he fi nal control action of risk monitoring and controlling is to record actual data for future use this includes all of the relevant information relating to risk management from start to fi nish of the project the defi nition of what this information must include as well as the storage mechanism should have been previously specifi ed in the risk management plan the goal is to ensure that the signifi cant risk management information is recorded to provide concrete data to the lessons learned process for inclusion in a lessons learned document report or other communication vehicle typical information includes the following for each identifi ed risk or type of risk whether it occurred and if so when and how often all relevant data should be recorded impact effectiveness of detection and of response and any unplanned additional actions that were carried out effectiveness of avoidance or exploitation actions effectiveness of transfer and sharing actions unexpected or undocumented risks which occurred and data about them effectiveness of risk mitigation and enhancement actions occurrence of accepted threats or opportunities c onsolidated information should be provided on the level of effort expended costs and benefi ts to the project of risk management activities should also be provided t his information will need to be archived and indexed in a manner that will facilitate retrieval for easy review during the project at closure and for future projects when the need arises 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 55 a appendix a guidelines for a pmi practice standard a1 introduction a pmi practice standard is characterized as follows cid129 e ach practice standard provides guidelines on the mechanics eg nuts and bolts basics fundamentals stepbystep usage guide how it operates how to do it of some signifi cant process input tool technique or output that is relevant to a project manager cid129 a practice standard does not necessarily mirror the lifecycle phases of many projects however an individual practice standard may be applicable to the completion of one or more phases within a project cid129 a practice standard does not necessarily mirror the knowledge areas within a guide to the project management body of knowledge pmbok guide fourth edition although an individual practice standard will provide suffi cient detail and background for one or more of the inputs tools and techniques andor outputs therefore practice standards are not required to use the name of any knowledge area cid129 e ach practice standard should include information on what the signifi cant process is and does why it is signifi cant how to perform it when it should be performed and if necessary for further clarifi cation who should perform it cid129 each practice standard should include information that is accepted and applicable for most projects most of the time within the project management community processes that are generally restricted or applicable to one industry country or companion profession ie an application area may be included as an appendix for informational purposes rather than as part of the practice standard with strong support and evidence an application areaspecifi c process may be considered as an extension practice standard in the same manner as extensions to the pmbok guide fourth edition are considered cid129 each practice standard will benefi t from the inclusion of examples and templates it is best when an example or template includes a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses a background description may be necessary to put this discussion in the appropriate context the examples should be aligned with the relevant information in the standard or its appendix and placed in proximity to that information cid129 all practice standards shall be written in the same general style and format cid129 e ach practice standard project will be aligned with or reference other practice standards as needed cid129 each practice standard will be consistent with the p mbok guide fourth edition cid129 each practice standard is intended to be more prescriptive than the pmbok guide fourth edition 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 57 b appendix b evolution of pmis practice standard for project risk management b1 preproject i n early 2005 pmi began exploration for developing the fi rst practice standard for project risk management focus would be placed on single project risk management for a single project rather than including programs or portfolios of projects with close coupling to the project risk management section of a guide to the project management body of knowledge pmbok guide third edition by april 20 2006 the pmi standards members advisory group mag approved the following fi nal charter for the standard with cynthia a berg pmp as the project manager and dr david hulett as the deputy project manager the charter included the following characteristics for the standard p rovides information on project risk management that includes information that is clear complete relevant and generally recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time i s consistent with the pmbok guide third edition expanding but not contradicting the concepts and techniques related to project risk management and keeps within the limits and practices of project risk management as described within chapter 11 of the p mbok guide third edition has been reviewed and updated by the practice standard for project risk management project team i s written for project management practitioners and other stakeholders of the project management profession describes the processes that are unique to project risk management includes in an appendix examples and templates of specifi c project risk management processes tools andor techniques addressed in the practice standard with discussions of their strengths and weaknesses including background descriptions that put the relative strengths and weaknesses into context uses the pmbok g uide third edition glossary as the starting point of its glossary and does not contain contradictions uses a glossary term in the text without defi nition or additional explanation is aligned with and does not contradict other pmi standards follows the pmi style guide is written in north american english translatable to pmi offi cial languages and is sensitive to cultural issues 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 59 b appendix b c an be approved as a pmi standard which means that in addition to the content being acceptable the process for selecting team members and soliciting and responding to comments on the product must be open and inclusive b2 preliminary work in recognition that risk management is not practiced well on many projects the project team set out to identify practices that are viewed as best practices as those are understood and applied in most successfully managed projects most of the time t he project core team was initially formed in the fall of 2005 and consisted of dr david hillson pmp kik piney and kris persun b3 scope changes during the time the project was chartered the p mbok g uide fourth edition was commissioned as a result the charter of the practice standard for project risk management was expanded to be consistent and noncontradictory with that standard b4 exposure and consensus the standard was submitted as an exposure draft in the winter of 2007 and exposed on 23 march 2008 there were 849 comments the teams comment acceptance rate comments accepted outright and accepted with modifi cations was 57 the pmi standards manager submitted the resultant fi nal draft with the concurrence of the pmi standards program mag to the pmi standards program consensus body for offi cial ballot on 27 march 2009 twentyeight members of the pmi standards program consensus body agreed to participate in the ballot of the practice standard for project risk management those not participating included the pm and deputy pm for this standard because their participation was considered a confl ict of interest the balloting period was closed on 25 april 2009 with 23 ballots returned consensus body voting results were as follows 22 affi rmative and 1 affi rmative with comment the affi rmative with comment pertained to

importance to be assigned to these objectives eg reliability takes precedence over time etc this may be in the form of numerical weights that can be applied to create a single weighted sum over all objectives for each risk any other features that may affect the urgency of dealing with a risk should also be specifi ed eg one linked to a resource that will soon disappear should be given greater

this technique requires three steps 1 list assumptions and constraints for the project 2 test assumptions and constraints by asking two questions a could the assumptionconstraint be false b if it were false would one or more project objectives be affected positively or negatively 3 where both questions are answered yes generate a risk for example in the form assumption constraint may prove false

the standard rules of brainstorming are often modifi ed when the technique is applied to risk identifi cation for example it is common to structure the risk identifi cation brainstorm using risk categories or a risk breakdown structure some evaluation of proposed risks is often included in a risk identifi cation brainstorm to remove nonrisks it is important to ensure active participation of relevant stakeholders in a risk identifi cation brainstorm and for the facilitator to manage group dynamics carefully no templates or examples are presented in this appendix d213 cause and effect ishikawa diagrams t his technique presents in diagrammatic form the causes which contribute to a given outcome each main cause can be split further into subcauses to use this technique for risk identifi cation the outcome should be stated as an effect on a project objective ie the impact of a risk the diagram then identifi es risks as those uncertain events which could result in occurrence of the impact care needs to be taken when using this technique for risk identifi cation to distinguish between risks uncertain causes of the impact and issues certain causes of the impact an example

compiled to capture previous project experience and allow it to be used for subsequent similar projects it is possible to structure the risk identifi cation checklist around a risk breakdown structure as shown in the partial example below it is useful to present the checklist as a set of risks each of which is considered in turn to determine whether it might be relevant to the project under consideration risk identifi cation checklists should include both threats and opportunities figure d3 example fragment of a checklist with typical structure of category subcategory specific risks and effect d215 delphi technique the delphi technique uses a facilitated anonymous polling of subject matter experts to identify risks in their area of expertise the facilitator gathers the experts initial responses and circulates them without attribution to the group who may revise their contributions based on those of others the process often generates a consensus of the experts in a few iterations no templates or examples are presented d216 document review risks can be identifi ed through careful review of project documentation including the project charter statement of work contract

analysis of a model structured to identify the various elements that can cause system failure by themselves or in combination with others 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 78 d appendix d based on the logic of the system fault tree analysis is typically used in engineering contexts it can be adapted for use to identify risks by analyzing how risk impacts might arise another result is the probability of failure or of reliability mean time between failure etc of the overall system indicating the level of quality of the system or product if the level of reliability is not acceptable the fault tree can indicate where the system can be made more reliabletherefore it is useful in the design and engineering phase of the project an example is shown below figure d4 fault tree analysis of the possible causes of a crash at the main road junction this will be changed to be more projectoriented d218 force field analysis force field analysis is typically used in the change management context it can be adapted for risk identifi cation by identifying driving forces forces for change and restraining forces forces against change which currently affect achievement of a project objective risks can then be identifi ed as uncertain events or conditions which would lead to a change in the strength of one or more of the identifi ed forces an example force fi eld diagram is shown below 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 79 d appendix d figure d5 example of a force field analysis and the balance

which can be used to stimulate risk identifi cation the prompt list may be presented as a risk breakdown structure see below or as a set of headings a number of standard prompt lists have been developed for use in risk identifi cation and some of these are presented below these can then be used as a framework for other risk identifi cation techniques such as brainstorming see d212 or risk

identify common sources of several risks leading to broadreaching risk response strategies similarly care needs to be taken when using this technique for risk identifi cation to distinguish between risks uncertain causes of the impact and issues certain causes of the impact in the diagram shown below the risks that were initially identifi ed included rework extra cost schedule slips low team morale customer mistrust and repeated audits an examination of the identifi ed risks lead to a common root cause that later phases of the project were typically started before the earlier ones were suffi ciently mature this organization repeatedly ignored the proper phase entry prerequisites hastening later project stages in order to speed up the project figure d8 example of a root cause analysis d2118 swot analysis swot analysis identifi es four characteristics of a given situation strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats the technique is commonly used in strategic decision making it can be adapted for risk identifi cation by changing the interpretation of the four perspectives such that strengths and weaknesses relate to the characteristics of the organization conducting the project and opportunities and threats identify the project risks the technique is particularly useful for identifying internallygenerated risks arising from within the organization for example opportunities might be found by leveraging organizational strengths or threats might arise as a result of organizational weaknesses as illustrated below 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 84 d appendix d figure d9 example of a swot analysis structure d2119 system dynamics system dynamics sd is a particular application of infl uence diagrams see above and can be used to identify risks within a project situation the sd model represents entities and information fl ows within a project and analysis of the model can reveal feedback and feedforward loops which lead to uncertainty or instability in addition the results of an sd analysis can show the impact of risk events on overall project results such as the cost or schedule results to be expected analyses of changes in the model or assumptions can indicate the systems sensitivity to specifi c events some of which may be risks a simple example of an sd diagram is shown in figure

objectives rootcause analysis see chapter 5 d311 estimating techniques applied to probability and impact the probability of a risk occurring can be specifi ed in several different ways one common way is to assign levels of risk probability by ranges of probability one benefi t of this approach is that the subject matter experts only need to assess a risks probability within a range rather than as a specifi c value an example assuming that a 55 probability and impact matrix is desired is shown in figure d11 where the probability ranges are more tightly defi ned at low levels of probability examples of impact level defi nitions are very projectspecifi c the values used to specify the level of impact from very low to very high if a 55 matrix is being used should be h igher impact for threats or opportunities as they move from very low to very high for a specifi c objective l evels are defi ned by the organization as causing the same amount of pain or gain to the project for each level across objectives i f a risks possible impact is uncertain and could be assigned to more than one level of impact eg from moderate to high the analyst may choose to assign the risk to the impact level that represents the expected or average impact alternatively the risk may be fl agged for extra analysis in order to reduce the range of uncertainty to fi t within a single range a n example of impact level defi nitions is shown in figure d11 these defi nitions should be tailored or scaled by stakeholders to the specifi c project the defi nitions appropriately tailored to the project can be used for opportunities and threats 2009 project management institute practice standard for project risk management 88 d appendix d figure d11 example of definitions for levels of probability and

impact scale is interpreted negatively ie time delays increased cost or reduced functionality d 312 probability and impact matrix organizations typically assess a risks priority on an objective from the combination of probability of occurrence and impact on that project objective using defi nitions such as those shown in figure d11 risks are then placed on a probability and impact pi matrix such

Next, we calculate the frequency of each concept by grouping the filtered data and counting occurrences, storing the results in a new DataFrame. The frequency data is then sorted in descending order to highlight the most common concepts, with the top 20 concepts extracted and displayed for further analysis. This method effectively highlights essential concepts within the text for subsequent tasks."

        "In this section, we perform two key analyses: calculating the Levenshtein distance for synonyms and computing the TF-IDF scores for the extracted text. First, we define a function to calculate the Levenshtein distance, which measures the similarity between a given word and its similar words, as identified through a previously defined method (find_similar_words). For each word in the list of most common concepts, we find the top five similar words and print the Levenshtein distance along with cosine similarity values. If no similar words are found, a message is displayed accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we proceed to calculate TF-IDF scores to assess the importance of words in the context of the extracted text. We rebuild the cleaned and lemmatized sentences into a list, which is then transformed into a TF-IDF matrix using TfidfVectorizer. This matrix quantifies the importance of each word across all sentences. We extract the feature names (terms) and their corresponding mean TF-IDF scores, storing them in a DataFrame. Finally, we sort this DataFrame by TF-IDF score in descending order and print the top 20 words with the highest scores, providing insights into the most significant terms within the text."
