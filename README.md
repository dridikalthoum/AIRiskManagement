# 🌟 AI-Based Content Recommendation System 🌟

This project is part of an academic module focused on building an advanced content-based recommendation system using cutting-edge techniques in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Knowledge Graphs**. The system aims to extract knowledge from standard corpora and transform it into structured, interpretable graphs to provide meaningful, concept-based recommendations. 

## 🎯 **Project Goals**
The primary goal of this project is to develop a recommendation system capable of analyzing textual content, extracting meaningful insights, and converting these into **knowledge graphs**. This enables the system to deliver **accurate**, **concept-based recommendations** by leveraging relationships between entities and their attributes.

## 🗝️ **Key Objectives**
- 📂 **Extract & Segment Data**: Process data from standard corpora like **PMI_RM** and **PMBOK7**.
- 🔍 **Identify Key Concepts**: Use NLP techniques to extract relevant **concepts**, **attributes**, and their relationships.
- 🌐 **Build a Knowledge Graph**: Create a **graph** that represents extracted concepts, with **semantic** and **taxonomic relationships**.
- 📊 **Evaluate Extraction Process**: Use advanced metrics to assess the efficiency and accuracy of knowledge extraction.

## 🛠️ **Technologies & Tools**
This project employs a variety of modern AI and NLP technologies to achieve its objectives:

- 🧠 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: 
  - Tokenization
  - Normalization
  - Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging
  - Chunking for content segmentation.
  
- 🔗 **Knowledge Extraction**: Identify concepts, calculate frequency, and extract relationships from textual data.

- 🕸️ **Knowledge Graphs**: 
  - Transform extracted data into a semi-structured **graph**.
  - Include **semantic** and **taxonomic relationships** for enhanced content understanding.

- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Use **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **LLMs** to improve the accuracy and precision of content recommendations.

## 📏 **Metrics for Evaluation**
We evaluate the success of this project through the following metrics:

- 🧮 **Levenshtein Distance**: Measure the difference between extracted and true entities.
- ✨ **TFIDF**: Assess the relevance of keywords and entities.
- 🏆 **F-measure**: Gauge the accuracy of concept extraction and knowledge graph generation.

## 🖼️ **Evaluation & Visualizations**
The success of this project will be measured by:

- 🧩 **Relevance of Extracted Concepts**: How accurately key concepts and relationships are identified.
- 🌐 **Accuracy of the Knowledge Graph**: The coherence and accuracy of the generated **knowledge graph**.
- 🎯 **Effectiveness of Recommendations**: How well the system provides **accurate**, **content-based suggestions**.

## 🏫 **Academic Context**
This project is part of an academic module on **Artificial Intelligence** and **Data Science**, combining theoretical insights with practical application. It explores how advanced AI techniques can be applied to solve real-world challenges in content recommendation and **knowledge extraction**.
