PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS 
 7.1  Purpose and Objectives of the Perform Quantitative Risk 
Analysis Process 
 The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process provides a numerical estimate of the overall effect of risk on 
the objectives of the project, based on current plans and information, when considering risks simultaneously. 
Results from this type of analysis can be used to evaluate the likelihood of success in achieving project 
objectives and to estimate contingency reserves, usually for time and cost that are appropriate to both the risks 
and the risk tolerance of project stakeholders. 
 It is generally accepted that analyzing uncertainty in the project using quantitative techniques such as 
Monte Carlo simulation may provide more realism in the estimate of the overall project cost or schedule 
than a non-probabilistic approach which assumes that the activity durations or line-item cost estimates are 
deterministic. However it should be recognized that quantitative risk analysis is not always required or appropriate 
for all projects. For example, qualitative risk analysis may provide enough information for development of 
effective risk responses, especially for smaller projects. Therefore, during the Plan Risk Management process, 
the beneﬁ ts of quantitative risk analysis should be weighed against the effort required to ensure that the 
additional insights and value justify the additional effort. 
 Partial risk analyses, such as qualitative risk analysis, aim at prioritizing individual risks viewed one at a time 
and therefore cannot produce measures of overall project risk when all risks are considered simultaneously. 
Calculating estimates of overall project risk is the focus of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. 
 Speciﬁ c project risks are usually best understood and quantiﬁ ed at a detailed level such as the line-item 
cost or schedule activity level. By contrast, project objectives such as achievement of the project’s budget or the schedule are specified at a higher level, often at the level of the total project. An overall risk analysis, such 
as one that uses quantitative techniques, estimates the implication of all quantified risks on project objectives. 
The implementation of overall risk analysis using quantitative methods requires: 
  Complete and accurate representation of the project objectives built up from individual project 
• 
elements. Examples of these representations include the project schedule or cost estimate. 
  Identifying risks on individual project elements such as schedule activities or line-item costs at a 
• 
level of detail that lends itself to specific assessment of individual risks. 
 Including generic risks that have a broader effect than individual project elements. 
• 
  Applying a quantitative method (such as Monte Carlo simulation or decision tree analysis) that incorporates 
• 
multiple risks simultaneously in determining overall impact on the overall project objective. 




Figure 7-1: Comparison of Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches


This image presents a side-by-side comparison of qualitative and quantitative risk analysis approaches, with the two processes described in separate boxes:


1. Qualitative Risk Analysis:
   - Addresses individual risks descriptively.
   - Assesses the discrete probability of occurrence and impact on objectives if it does occur.
   - Prioritizes individual risks for subsequent treatment.
   - Adds to risk register.
   - Leads to quantitative risk analysis.


2. Quantitative Risk Analysis:
   - Predicts likely project outcomes based on combined effects of risks.
   - Uses probability distributions to characterize the risk's probability and impact.
   - Uses project models (e.g., schedule, cost estimate).
   - Requires a quantitative method, requiring expertise.
   - Estimates the likelihood of meeting targets and contingency needed to achieve the desired level of comfort.
   - Identifies risks with the greatest effect on overall project risk.


This comparison highlights the key differences between the two approaches, with qualitative risk analysis being more descriptive and qualitative, and quantitative risk analysis relying on models and statistical methods for predicting risk impacts.


 Results of the quantitative analysis will be compared to the project plan (baseline or current) to give 
management an estimate of the overall project risk and will answer important questions such as: 
 What is the probability of meeting the project’s objectives? 
• 
  How much contingency reserve (e.g., reserves or buffers of time, resources, and cost) is needed to 
• 
provide the organization with the level of certainty it requires based upon its risk tolerance? 
  What are those parts of the project, such as line-item costs or schedule activities, which contribute 
• 
the most risk when all risks are considered simultaneously? 
 Which individual risks contribute the most to overall project risk? 
• 
 Estimating overall project risk using quantitative methods helps distinguish those projects where quantiﬁ ed 
risks threaten objectives beyond the tolerance of the stakeholders, from those for which the objectives are 
within acceptable tolerances even when risk is considered. The former may be targeted for vigorous risk 
responses aimed at protecting those objectives most important to the stakeholders. 
 A high-level comparison of quantitative and qualitative risk analysis processes is presented in Figure 7-1.

 7.2  Critical Success Factors for the Perform Quantitative Risk 
Analysis Process 
 Success in achieving the objectives of quantitative risk analysis depends explicitly on at least the factors 
described in Sections 7.2.1 through 7.2.6. 


 7.2.1 Prior Risk Identiﬁ cation and Qualitative Risk Analysis 
 The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process occurs after the Identify Risks and Perform Qualitative 
Risk Analysis processes have been completed. Reference to a prioritized list of identified risks ensures 
that the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process will consider all significant risks when analyzing their 
effects quantitatively. 
 7.2.2 Appropriate Project Model 
 An appropriate model of the project should be used as the basis for quantitative risk analysis. Project 
models most frequently used in quantitative risk analysis include the project schedule (for time), line-item 
cost estimates (for cost), decision tree (for decisions in the face of uncertainty) and other total-project models. 
Quantitative risk analysis is especially sensitive to the completeness and correctness of the model of the 
project that is used. 
 7.2.3 Commitment to Collecting High-Quality Risk Data 
 Often high-quality data about risks are not available in any historic database and should be gathered 
by interviews, workshops, and other means using expert judgment of those present. Collection of risk data 
requires resources and time as well as management support. 
 7.2.4 Unbiased Data 
 Success in gathering risk analysis data requires the ability to recognize when biases occur and combating 
that bias or developing other unbiased sources of the data. Bias in risk data can occur for many reasons, but two common sources of bias are cognitive bias and motivational bias. 
 7.2.5 Overall Project Risk Derived from Individual Risks 
 The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is based upon a methodology that correctly derives the 
overall project risk from the individual risks. In risk analysis of cost and schedule, for example, an appropriate method is Monte Carlo simulation. A decision tree is an appropriate method for making decisions when future 
events are not certain, using the probability and impact of all risks, and combining their effect to derive an 
overall project measure such as value or cost. In each of these methods, the risks are speciﬁ ed at the level 
of the detailed tasks or line-item costs and incorporated into the model of the project to calculate effects on 
objectives such as schedule or cost for the entire project, by combining those risks. 


 7.2.6 Interrelationships Between Risks in Quantitative Risk Analysis 
 Attention should be given to the possibility that the individual risks in the project model are related to 
each other. For example, several risks may have a common root cause and therefore are likely to occur 
together. This possibility is sometimes addressed by correlating the risks that are related, ensuring that 
they generally occur together during the analysis. Another common way to represent the risks which occur 
together is by using the risk register listing of the risk or root cause and attaching it to several project 
elements such as schedule activities or cost elements. When a particular risk occurs, the affected elements 
will all experience the effect of that risk together. 
 7.3  Tools and Techniques for the Perform Quantitative Risk 
Analysis Process 
 Tools and techniques used appropriately for quantitative risk analysis have several characteristics, as 
follows: 
 7.3.1 Comprehensive Risk Representation 
 Risk models permit representation of many, if not all, of the risks that have impact on an objective 
simultaneously. They also permit the representation of both opportunities and threats to the project’s 
objectives. 
 7.3.2 Risk Impact Calculation 
 Quantitative models facilitate the correct calculation of the effect of many risks, which are typically identiﬁ ed 
and quantiﬁ ed at a level of detail below the total project, on the project objectives, which are typically described 
at the level of the total project. 
 7.3.3 Quantitative Method Appropriate to Analyzing Uncertainty 
 Probability models use a quantitative method that addresses uncertainty. Speciﬁcally, the methods should 
be able to handle the way uncertainty is represented, predominantly as probability of an event’s occurring or as 
probability distributions for a range of outcomes. A good example of this is the use of Monte Carlo simulation 
tools that permit the combination of probability distributions of line-item costs or schedule activity durations, 
many of which are uncertain. 
 7.3.4 Data Gathering Tools 
 Data gathering tools used in this process include assessment of historical data and workshops, interviews, or 
questionnaires to gather quantiﬁ ed information—for example, on the probability of a risk occurring, a probability 
distribution of its potential impacts on cost or time, or relationships such as correlation between risks.

 7.3.5 Effective Presentation of Quantitative Analysis Results 
 Results from the quantitative tools are generally not available in standard deterministic project management 
methods such as project scheduling or cost estimating. Examples of these are the probability distribution of 
project completion dates or total costs and the expected value of a project decision. These results, when all 
risks are considered simultaneously, include the following: 
 Probability of achieving a project objective such as ﬁnishing on time or within budget. 
• 
  Amount of contingency reserve in cost, time, or resources needed to provide a required level of 
• 
conﬁ dence. 
  Identity or location within the project model of the most important risks. An example of this is a 
• 
sensitivity analysis in a cost risk analysis or a criticality analysis in a schedule risk analysis. 
 The elements of a quantitative risk analysis are illustrated in Figure 7-2.

  7.3.6 Iterative Quantitative Risk Analysis 
 The success of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process is enhanced if the process is used periodically 
throughout the project. It is impossible to know in advance all of the risks that may occur in a project. Often 
quantitative risk analysis should be repeated as the project proceeds. The frequency of this effort will be 
determined during the Plan Risk Management process but will also depend on events within the project itself 
(see Monitor and Control Risks, Chapter 9). 
 7.3.7 Information for Response Planning 
 Overall project contingency reserve in time and cost should be reﬂected in the project’s schedule and 
budget. Quantitative risk analysis provides information that may be used to modify the project plan. If 
the overall risk to time and cost indicates that an adjustment in scope is needed, the scope changes are 
agreed upon and documented and a new quantitative risk analysis is carried out to reﬂ ect the new aspects 
of the project. 
 7.4  Documenting the Results of the Perform Quantitative Risk 
Analysis Process 
 The contingency reserves calculated in quantitative project cost and schedule risk analysis are incorporated, 
respectively, into the cost estimate and the schedule to establish a prudent target and a realistic expectation 
for the project. Contingency reserves may also be established to provide for the capture of opportunities that 
are judged to be priorities for the project. If the contingency reserve required exceeds the time or resources 
available, changes in the project scope and plan may result. 
 Also, the results of the analysis may provide more or less urgency to risk response (see Plan Risk Responses, 
Chapter 8) depending on the probability of achieving the plan’s objectives or the amount of contingency reserve 
required to provide the necessary level of confidence. The results of a quantitative risk analysis are recorded 
and passed on to the person and/or group responsible for project management within the organization for any 
further actions required to make full use of these results. 


 PLAN RISK RESPONSES 
 The Plan Risk Responses process determines effective response actions that are appropriate to the priority 
of the individual risks and to the overall project risk. It takes into account the stakeholders’ risk attitudes and 
the conventions speciﬁ ed in the Risk Management Plan, in addition to any constraints and assumptions that 
were determined when the risks were identified and analyzed. 
 8.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Responses Process 
 The objective of the Plan Risk Responses process is to determine the set of actions which most enhance the 
chances of project success while complying with applicable organizational and project constraints. 
 Once risks have been identiﬁ ed, analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be developed for addressing every 
risk the project team considers to be sufﬁciently important, either because of the threat it poses to the project 
objectives or the opportunity it offers. The planning entails agreeing upon the actions to be taken and the 
potential changes to budget, schedule, resources, and scope which these actions might cause. 
 Contingent risk response actions need to be executed at the optimum time. For this reason, the response 
specification for each such risk should include a description of any corresponding trigger conditions. 
 The responsibility for monitoring the project conditions and implementing the corresponding actions should 
be clearly assigned. Every risk should have been allocated to a risk owner as part of the Identify Risks process, 
and each of the corresponding risk responses should now be assigned to a specific risk action owner. The risk 
owner is responsible for ensuring that the risk response is effective and for planning additional risk responses 
if required, whereas the risk action owner is responsible for ensuring that the agreed-upon risk responses are 
carried out as planned, in a timely manner. The role of the risk owner and that of the risk action owner may be 
assigned to a single person. 
 Responses, when implemented, can have potential effects on the project objectives and, as such, can 
generate additional risks. These are known as secondary risks and have to be analyzed and planned for in the 
same way as those risks which were initially identified. 
 It is never feasible or even desirable to eliminate all threats from a project. Similarly, there is also a limit 
to the extent to which opportunities can be proactively managed. There may be residual risks that will remain 
after the responses have been implemented. These residual risks should be clearly identiﬁ ed, analyzed, 
documented, and communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
